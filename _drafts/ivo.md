# inner(voice)over

- hear from the [self-compassion database] and add your voice
- see the [code]

Could AI rewrite one's inner critic? _inner(voice)over_ combines AI speech-to-text analysis and text-to-speech synthesis to question the origins of inner voices and to shift what influences an individual's outlook. Users speak a kind phrase into its acoustic dishes, and _inner(voice)over_ uses Mozilla DeepSpeech to anonymize their words and add them to its self-compassion database. Then users can hear what others have shared, restated in a synthesized AI voice.

By collaboratively rewriting a communal inner voice using AI---and by attending to imperfections of technological and human communications alike---this experiment explores the possibility of influencing each other through language altered across digital distances.

### web app version

Visit [innervoiceover.com] for the web app, still in development. I'm interested in how the physical, communal experience can translate or expand into fully digital, distributed spaces. I've spent this summer rebuilding the database on a new server, and I will need to find a new AI voice synthesis solution soon. In the meantime I am considering an "organic"-intelligent solution, recording the text-to-speech as homemade ASMR recordings, as a form of "mechanical turking" or performing database care.
