Welcome to Glitch
=================

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code may take a few seconds to deploy and update.

Click `Tools -> Logs` in the bottom left to see your app build in real time. This is also where you can find errors when they occur.

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

On the back-end,
