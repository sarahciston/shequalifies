## subject positions for this research
This body writes as a white queer cisgendered woman, raised rural working class now academic middle class with the associated privileges and safety that these positions affords. I write from a particular position, time and place (August 2020, Los Angeles, which is the unceded land of the Tongva People), and set of circumstances (global, regional, domain-specific, and personal)---that is to say, in the midst of pandemic and revolution, unsettling precarity and great disparity of resources, reworkings of how to research and learn together in these contexts, yet another a record-breaking heatwave plus potential rolling blackouts, and some impending personal strife currently being 'compartmentalized'. This is not a comprehensive list.

It is essential to include  subject positions as part of writing not only because they inform how and what I write, how it will be read and valued or devalued; but also more importantly because these also suggest the ways I cannot claim to speak for others, the ways my knowledge is unstable and in process and the product of broader community, uncertain. It rejects the white supremesist privilege of not needing to declare its subjectivity, of an assumed 'neutrality' that is all-encompassing and speaks with academic mastery. 

My approach to this work is inspired by approaches like Ruja Benjamin's "thin description," Johanna Zylinska's "minimal ethics," Joan Retallack's "poethics," and Catherine Dâ€™Ignazio and Lauren Klein's "data feminism," among others, which have vastly different tasks but all prioritize alternative epistemologies and humble approaches to scholarship that don't erase the scholar.  

Plus it is more interesting to me to write from a place of curiosity than certainty.
