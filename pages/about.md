## subject positions for this research
This body writes as a white queer cisgendered woman, raised rural working class now academic middle class with the associated privileges and safety that these positions affords.

It is essential to include these subject positions as part of these texts not only because they inform how and what I write, how it will be read and valued or devalued; but also more importantly because these also offer the ways I cannot and will not claim to speak for others, the spaces where I do not know, the areas where I am uncertain (many)...
