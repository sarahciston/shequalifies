**Oh hi there,**

You have landed on a (very bare) home page, which displays {{ site.title }}'s works in progress.

This site both tracks and is the qualifying exam for Sarah Ciston's Media Arts + Practice PhD. Its format reimagines academic scholarship as a live-coding, live-writing, embodied practice by referencing the visual frameworks of software documentation and by utilizing some of the cloud-based tools it also interrogates. The work is further embedded with metadata, multimedia, associative fragments that accrete throughout the writing process——blurring the edges across code work, creative work, critical work, and personal work, across the physical and immaterial platforms.
