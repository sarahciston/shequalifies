<!-- field1 -->
*[restorative processing]: TK.

<!-- field2 -->
*[algorithm]: A procedure, a set of instructions or the action of following them, or the culture around creating, implementing, or being affected by the power structures which rely on them.
*[api]: application program interface, instructions for interacting with a digital tool or platform using a programming language (e.g. as a 'machine'), rather than through a web browser (as a 'human')
*[dark sousveillance]: Simone Browne's term for the opposing strategies taken up by Black folks in resistence to surveillance practices from above. 
*[data]: The collection of information provided to an interpretive system, shaped to be interpretable by that system. Data is a form of inscription, data is writing. 
*[digital]: TK. Broken into discrete segments or digits, from the hands.
*[digital epidermalization]: Simone Browne (after Franz Fanon): “Digital epidermalization is the exercise of power cast by the disembodied gaze of certain surveillance technologies (for example, identity card readers and e-passport verification machines) that can be employed to do the work of alienating the subject by producing a truth about the racial body and one’s identity (or identities) despite the subject’s claims” (2015, 110).
*[creepvenience]: My term for the sometimes uncomfortable degrees intimacy (creepiness) users exchange for the helpful (convenient) aspects of algorithmic-cultural systems, such as gmail autocomplete. 
*[interface]: TK. Between faces.
*[internet of self]: My term for the distributed sense of self that is digitally entwined, the data body, both digitally co-present and acting without one's knowledge/authorization.
*[information]: Signal and noise. The more randomness, the more information.
*[materiality]: TK.
*[self]: The self is a technology. That is, in my and many others framing, the self is a conceptual tool used to interact with other parts of the world, rather than a unified, temporaly steady, non-permeable, individuated unit.
*[subscription capitalism]: Related to the sharing economy and the interface economy (Finn), my term for the shift to economies of abstracted order delivery and video viewing facilitated by algorithms rather than direct human interaction.

*[feminism]: To D’Ignazio & Klein, "a shorthand for the diverse and wide-ranging projects that name and challenge sexism and other forces of oppression, as well as those which seek to create more just, equitable, and livable futures" (6).
