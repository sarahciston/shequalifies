# glitch feminism and broken machines

In this ASMR video, I’ll touch you like you’re my iPad. Imagine my scroll, scroll, scroll down your skin. Thump, tap, swish, caress. My glass and your glass kiss. Through this we scratch the surface of bliss. 

Contactless delivery. Knock on my door. I wait ten minutes to step outside to retrieve my meal, to avoid being seen. I did this before, now it’s no longer strange. It’s everything else made strange. 
I reach (for) you. I reach (for) you. I reach (for) you. 

All the fans and purifiers running, all the weighted blankets thrumming, wireless charge. I want to lie against you like my phone rests on its wireless charger, peaceful. When it hits just the right spot, the haptic purr that says, “All is right. We have connected now. Go to sleep. I will be here when you wake up.” I want to lie on the ground and feel that way against the earth again.

I coregulate to your screen flicker, glitchy rhythm, portrait orientation, landscape mode, the image you paused. The middle-distance gaze of your multitasking multiple tabs while we face time. How do we face time when we time has stretched and splintered into pleading strings of doom thoughts? I am always impending. Belly grown with salty snacks,distending. I don’t recognize myself in how my friends and family have aged. Had we been aging this whole/entire (face) time? Can I face (time) the things/people I have lost, the thought is gone before it’s thought, too tidy and intransigent to be forgotten though, just sticking in the craw, in the pause of the glitch, almost unseen/uncaught, the video scrub, the frozen digitized expression of these closed zooms of these escape routes rewatched sitcoms that raised us replaced our aunts and grandmothers. We laughed before we knew the joke. 

Create from the constant fugue state of the migraine Did I eat today Is it Saturday I can tell by whether the plant was watered yesterday or needs water tomorrow Am I hungry Am I an iPad Am I an assembly line
