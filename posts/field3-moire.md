## moiré away

intersections, finding patterns in pre-set systems, emerging from a matrix
moire, mesh net sifts sorts what stays and goes, could be the matrix what supports the new thing that emerges out of it

moiré as metaphor? about crossing, vibrating, contains a secret intensity

requires movement, also creating another form of movement as illusion

requires relationships, alterity and proximity

relation to cinematic motion

Wernimont uses the metaphor of matrices as "the media in which something is generated or developed. As a generative form, the matrix is a powerful way of understanding and critiquing binary logics and simple, progressive narratives" (11). Citing Vivian M. May, she says it also grounds intersectional practice and thought, "intersectional work focuses on 'enmeshed multiplicities,' including but not limited to those of race and gender. It also entails a commitment to 'resistant forms of knowing' [...]. The matrix logic of intersectional feminism 'considers how inequalities intermingle,' and stresses linkages between 'the structural and experiential, and the material and the discursive'" (Wernimont 2018, 11).
