# current thinking

## co-writing with algorithms
- how the materiality of code language has changed natural language (& vice versa) 
- how even the practice of reading is now a form of writing, now that all text is datafied and our choices are digital, social, networked. Further, all writing is read into, haunted by the algorithmic systems in which we are deeply embedded and implicated. 
- how "linguistic capitalism" (Kaplan) helps us find the word we're looking for even as it narrows down choices and makes money on the space between words. I'm interested in the natural language processing of autocomplete and text generation--in particular the unwitting human co-authors who participate in creating those tools by having their text scraped for machine learning models.
- not just what these ML/NLP tools have to offer an expanded/obliterated definition of agency/authorship, but also how they require/inspire new experimental forms that interrogate and expand them through poetic practices
- where lie the boundaries of code and natural languages, code/backend and surface/frontend, material/ephemeral in the "stack" as its been conceived by various literary media theorists (particularly in relation to prior assumptions about print media). Do these boundaries matter? Or rather, how have they been culturally constructed or contributed to the obfuscation or creation of meaning? If form shapes content irrevocably, how do we make forms that more clearly reveal themselves, and their underpinnings, as such? How do artists reveal the systems (the stack) at work and how each part of these forms influence the whole?  


## immersive data identities
- how different specific bodies are interpollated through data gathering/processing systems as human and appropriate or less than according to neoliberal, late capitalistic, proprietary concerns that narrow the possibilities for being
- how these contemporary processes are rooted in long histories of racialization and colonialization practices and also overshadow analog antecedents and alternatives that did not map onto computational quantification but which left more space for plurality, e.g. paper diaries as an open interface vs an app with five emojis for mood as a closed interface   
- a view of the self as a technology that allows for critiques of post/humanism and "embodied remediation,"(Kember & Zylinska) using networked,  immersive data to consider a more relational intersubjectivity that requires a broader agential ecology and an ethics of care---one that can also imagine counter-strategies to the current, extractive methods of "data colonialism" (Couldry & Mejias).

### modify the loss
- What is a critical-creative-code form that can work by feel, incorporating the loop not only in its technical processes but in iterative affective systems? 
- _Modify the Loss_, along with the initial project of its name, represents a mode of working that is iterative, instinctual, subterranean, labyrinthian. 

### creative code collective
- How can this produce work, or document a process, or create a shared pedagological community that supports this work? 
- how
