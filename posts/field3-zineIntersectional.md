# why intersectional AI? moiré as a way of seeing

**["How is AI shifting power?"](nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02003-2)** 

This is the most important question to ask, rather than is this technology biased, fair, or good, says [Pratyusha Ria Kalluri](http://riakalluri.com/). They are a founder of the Radical AI Network and an AI researcher working on "ai and art that antioppressive and queerly beautiful." 

This mini-field-guide is part of a series looking at ideas, approaches, and examples bringing Intersectionality to AI.

### what intersectionality is (and isn't), what it can offer tech

Intersectionality is often misunderstood: In its original formulation by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, says Brittney Cooper (2016), it was not merely shorthand for discussing individual identity representation. Critics point out how this has allowed for even more granular marketing to these categories as they become visible to and targeted by capitalism (Chun 2018, 85). 

Rather, intersectionality is about power. It examines and critiques systems of power and how those systems structure themselves to impact groups and individuals unequally. Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein (2019) agree that intersectionality not only describes different aspects of an individual's position, but also "intersecting forces of privilege and oppression at work in a given society. Oppression involves the systematic mistreatment of certain groups of people by other groups. It happens when power is not distributed equally” (7–-8).

Intersectional feminism insists on not just meeting the needs of the most priviledged (white) women when arguing for feminism, or the needs of only Black men when combating anti-Blackness, but instead suggests that those with overlapping oppressions such as Black women face unique additional oppression; by addressing their circumstances, for example, life improves for everyone. 

Jacqueline Wernimont (2018) uses the metaphor of a matrix, as in, "the media in which something is generated or developed. As a generative form, the matrix is a powerful way of understanding and critiquing binary logics and simple, progressive narratives" (11). Citing Vivian M. May, she says it also grounds intersectional practice and thought, "intersectional work focuses on 'enmeshed multiplicities,' including but not limited to those of race and gender. It also entails a commitment to 'resistant forms of knowing' [...]. The matrix logic of intersectional feminism 'considers how inequalities intermingle,' and stresses linkages between 'the structural and experiential, and the material and the discursive'" (11). This suggests how intersectionality could offer a different lens through which to approach AI and technology in general. Intersectional AI as sketched out here is indebted to Crenshaw's original definition, as well as the concept's long lineages within Black and indigenous thought, for its critical lens to analyze technology and for its creative approach to redesigning it.

#### against inclusion, instead decentering

Guillermo Gómez-Peña says the high-tech world does not question itself as central, nor where it draws its borders: 

"We are no longer trying to persuade anyone that we are worthy of inclusion (we are de facto insiders/outsiders at the same time, or temporary insiders perhaps, and we know it). [...] What we wish is to remap the hegemonic cartography of cyberspace; to "politicize" the debate; to develop a multi centric theoretical understanding of the cultural, political and aesthetic possibilities of new technologies; to exchange a different sort of information (mytho poetical, activist, per formative, imagistic); and to hopefully do all this with humor and intelligence. Chicano artists in particular wish to "brownify" virtual space; to "spanglishize the net", and "infect" the lingua franca; [...] to find innovative grassroots applications to new technologies"

Lisa Nakamura, Sarah T. Roberts, and others have pointed to the many female and BIPOC tech workers who go unrecognized because their work is not the glamor work of tech, from the physically-taxing work of chip manufacturing on New Mexico reservations to the emotionally-taxing work of content moderation at sites just-off big tech campuses. Christina Dunbar-Hester (2020) argues that even "hacking has never been centered exclusively around white men in the Global North. Furthermore, some of what is required here is to simply shift the frame of what counts as hacking: to redraw boundaries to _place social and historical analysis and infrastructural care work within the purview of hacking._ In combination, these analytical adjustments can illuminate the 'others' of hacking---who are already here" (242). She adds that "diversity" fixes completely miss the problem, reversing cause and effect: "to frame social inequality as a question of diversity in technological production, and to expect to change wider inequities by adding 'diverse' individuals to technical cultures, is to misunderstand how the distribution of various social identities in a given sector are _outgrowths of differential social power_, not the other way around" (16).
 
By a similar logic, removing bias from algorithmic systems---even if that were possible (which, no.)---does not remove bias from culture, nor does it replace it with anything. Often, even well-meaning efforts to "remove" bias from systems fall back on quantitative/computational methods or resort to representation, which mirror the problems they claim to address, potentially even making tools to be misused in the future: "Representation as a goal may also result in accepting (and reproducing) notions of fixity in terms of social identity. This should raise skepticism" (236). These approaches do not examine the structure of the system itself, the logic upon which it is founded, both materially and intellectually. They do not ask who is creating, contributing, or benefitting from its operation. "Diversity [and, I argue, bias examination] is necessary, but not sufficient; it represents a shortcut in what should be a deeper conversation about values and justice" (Dunbar-Hester 2020, 241)

#### alternate histories & approaches 

>"But how can we define a ritual as ancient as the Agnicayana as algorithmic? To many, it may appear an act of cultural appropriation to read ancient cultures through the paradigm of the latest technologies. 

>"Nevertheless, claiming that abstract techniques of knowledge and artificial metalanguages belong uniquely to the modern industrial West is not only historically inaccurate but also an act and one of implicit _epistemic colonialism_ towards cultures of other places and other times. The French mathematician Jean-Luc Chabert has noted that “algorithms have been around since the beginning of time and existed well before a special word had been coined to describe them. Algorithms are simply a set of step by step instructions, to be carried out quite mechanically, so as to achieve some desired result.” Today some may see algorithms as a recent technological innovation implementing abstract mathematical principles. On the contrary, algorithms are among the most ancient and material practices, predating many human tools and all modern machines" (Pasquinelli 2019)

#### where algorithms & AI affect us
>“Data for Black Lives co-founder Yeshimabeit Milner reminds us that “[t]he decision to make every Black life count as three-fifths of a person was embedded in the electoral college, an algorithm that continues to be the basis of our current democracy.”” (Benjamin 2019, 5) “even just deciding what problem needs solving requires a host of judgments” (5)
“tech fixes often hide, speed up, and even deepen discrimination, while appearing to be neutral or benevolent when compared to the racism of a previous era” (Benjamin 2019, 4) 
“Codes are both reflective and predictive. They have a past and a future.” (Benjamin 2019, 3) 

#### whiteness and AI
>“what appears to be an absence in terms of being “cultureless” works more like a superpower. Invisibility, with regard to Whiteness, offers immunity. To be unmarked by race allows you to reap the benefits but escape responsibility for your role in an unjust system” (Benjamin 2019, 2) 
“The view that “technology is a neutral tool” ignores how race also functions like a tool, structuring whose literal voice gets embodied in AI. In celebrating diversity, tokenistic approaches to tech development fail to acknowledge how the White aesthetic colors AI. The “blandness” of Whiteness [...] is treated by programmers as normal, universal, and appealing.” (Benjamin 2019, 15)

### restorative processing - call to action, infrastructures of care

it's not just about bias but more broadly about care. For what and for whom do we truly care? And how do we demonstrate those values by where we orient (after Ahmed) ourselves, our attention, our resources? Along with all of the harm caused by technological and cultural bias, framing these issues in the positive rather than the negative makes this a question not just of what to remove but what to build in its place. 


### queer affects: null, break, reverb

>"there is a dynamic of connection and interaction on Tumblr based on a nonlinear, atemporal rhizomal exchange of affect and sensation, a 'queer reverb' of repeat and repeat; and there may be a possibility for this sort of transmission to buoy an antinormative or resistant politics” (Cho 47)
"if queer temporality is the condition, then refrain is the mechanics" (Cho 52). 

>“If constant connectivity provides us with a relational norm of sorts, then disconnection could function as a queer orientation device with the potential of creating openings for other ways of coming together, and other ways of staying together.” (64)
>“Once we conceptualise or otherwise sense how the break, or the possibility of a break, is that which makes the signal, something happens to how relations can be conceived, and how they might feel. Disconnection, as something that lives within every connection, as the backbone of connectivity, may help us rethink connectedness and relations on a fundamental affective level. Put differently, the vulnerability and disruptive quality of digital media can help us envision modes of being together in ways that challenge the norm of uninterrupted connectivity and relatedness. The break may not be the end, but a new beginning. The disconnect may not lessen, but intensify the connection, as well as open up for other connections, in parallel.” (73)

Citing several artists and scholars, Jacob Gabory points to "queer opacity [or] queer darkness as not only an aesthetic but an ethos" (Gaboury 2018, 148)

"not a politics of resistance but a refusal of the very terms of engagement." (Gaboury 2018, 149)

"how can we enact disappearance in such a way that does not erase difference?" (Gaboury 2018, 147). Gaboury calls for "forms of life that account for refusal as a situated practice---one that is explicitly raced and embodied, even as it would prefer not to articulate the situatedness of any single identity form." (Gaboury 2018, 148)

"NULL in the relational model is not a synonym for an empty string or the numerical value 0. While the number 0 would indicate an explicit lack of some quantiﬁable thing, and therefore be numerically meaningful in the calculation of a given value, NULL indicates the absence of any value whatsoever, such that linguistically it is not considered a value at all, but rather a “marker” that indicates a state of indeterminacy." (Gaboury 2018, 152)

"The use of NULL thus marks an indeterminate mode of being that is at once within and outside, part of and illegible to a discrete system of relations, a “middle” that explicitly marks an indeterminate, incalculable, unknown state of being." (Gaboury 2018, 153)

"the NULL marker corresponds with the epistemological condition of queerness as an excessive illegibility collapsed into an unwieldy frame, an aberrant third-ness within an otherwise normative system of relations. In this sense, NULL is not a state of being, but rather a mode of relation invested in the production of unknowable markers, a practice of becoming." (Gaboury 2018, 153)

"Centering black[^black data] and queer life [...] offers a radical reformulation of the subtractive mode offered by the NULL marker as a technological form, that is, as a tactic of negotiated visibility that removes itself from the productive logic of the system that would seek to identify it." (Gaboury 2018, 154)

[^black data]: Gaboury cites Shaka McGlotten's concept of 'black data', and the dehumanization of black and queer life to construct and stabilize the white political techno subject,  which I want to read up on next.
