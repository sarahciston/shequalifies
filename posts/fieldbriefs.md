# field briefs

## co-writing with algorithms
- how the materiality of code language has changed natural language (& vice versa); how the culturally prescribed boundaries break down between material/digital, code-depth/backend and interface-surface/frontend as its been conceived by various media theorists (particularly in relation to prior assumptions about print media); how these boundaries have contributed to the obfuscation or creation of meaning, ways of knowing, and the human actors behind them. What knowledge systems could replace these binaries or inhabit their borderspaces? What forms can reveal not only how form shapes content irrevocably, but also how form is inseparable from content and the larger cultural systems that constitute it? 
- how even the practice of reading is now a form of writing, now that all text is datafied and our choices are digital, social, networked. Further, all writing is read into, influenced by the algorithmic systems in which we are deeply embedded and implicated, which express in more extreme ways the influences we already bring to analog reading. 
- how algorithmic co-writing helps us find the word we're looking for even as it narrows down choices and capitalizes on the space between words. I'm interested in the natural language processing of autocomplete and text generation---in particular the human co-authors who unwitting participate when corporate interests extract their text to create machine learning models but who have no say in shaping their design or applications. As power relations are amplified, particular interests become legible or illegible as they are processed algorithmically: How does this shape the new algorithmically co-written ‘voice’ of writers?
- not only what these ML/NLP tools have to offer an expanded/obliterated definition of agency/authorship, but also how they require/inspire new experimental forms that interrogate their problematic current uses and expand their creative, even activist imaginaries through poetic practices


## immersive data identities
- how different specific bodies are interpellated through data gathering/processing systems as human or less-than according to neoliberal, white supremacist, patriarchal, and proprietary concerns that narrow the possibilities for being. Whether mistakenly labeled as terrorist from your cell phone’s GPS footprint or being misgendered or simply better marketed to, these identities created by data-extractive algorithmic systems, our representative ‘data bodies’,  have different material embodied stakes for different individuals. 
- this foreclosure of subject positions and modes of imagining selves and community identities is increasingly immersive and emphasized within algorithmic systems, but is informed by analog historical processes of racialization and colonialism originating in particular from the Atlantic slave trade, which by design extract bodies’ data and labor, limiting their material agency, their social imaginaries, and their lives. 
- some subversive survival strategies and analog antecedents were overshadowed when they did not map onto quantifiable data systems, but may provide alternative models with more space for plurality (e.g. paper diaries as an open interface vs a mood app with five predetermined choices as a closed interface). 
- when enacted computationally and at scale, data identities fracture and complicate the individualistic Western idea of ‘self.’ Rather, concepts of self and technology are co-extensive, continuous (a false dichotomy), calling for new understandings of identification that are temporal, performative, distributed, technophenomenological, embedded with active data, and accountable to their interrelations. If a self _is_ a technology, this allows for a critique of post/humanism and data culture that uses networked, immersive data to reveal relational intersubjectivity without flattening inequity. It calls for a broader agential ecology and an ethics of care as counter-strategies to current exploitative methods, including a reconsideration of what ‘counts’ as data and how it is owned, offered, optimized, interpreted, and embodied. 


## intersectional AI
- the popular literature is catching on that automated systems skew to existing power, and I’ve written elsewhere on how AI should be critiqued using intersectionality as both a critical lens and a mode of praxis. To take it further here, I’m interested in how Intersectional AI is made: how it is taken up by current makers and collectives, which principles and practices guide its creation and application, what counter-histories/counter-imaginaries offer counter-trajectories to the present assumptions about what automated systems must do (namely to categorize difference, to map its patterns, but only those which can be reduced to the computable). 
-  imagine AI systems and their supporting infrastructures instead informed by Black, indigenous, POC, queer, feminist ways of knowing, their long histories of handmade media and craft techniques and aesthetics, their communities of care, their strategies for passing and flagging and for surviving violent systems. 
- an intersectional stack(s) (wouldn’t be called a stack but) would originate from and serve the needs of its own communities; would understand its material relationships as an ecology; would embrace error, delay, and ambiguity; and would not try to be everything to everyone. It would value multiplicity, interrelation, polyvocality, multimodality. in my own practice, I’m interested in what critical-creative-code-community modalities can produce this kind of work, or document its iterative and instinctual naturess, or create shared spaces that support its generation. More broadly, I argue for an essential relationship between experimental artistic-research and tactical-media approaches like this and larger-scale real-world applications.
