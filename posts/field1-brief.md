# co-writing with algorithms

_How does language change within algorithmic systems, and how does it change us?_

## field brief

### area of interest, why the field matters to me

- how the materiality of code language has changed natural language (& vice versa); how the culturally prescribed boundaries break down between material/digital, code-depth/backend and interface-surface/frontend as its been conceived by various media theorists (particularly in relation to prior assumptions about print media); how these boundaries have contributed to the obfuscation or creation of meaning, ways of knowing, and the human actors behind them. What knowledge systems could replace these binaries or inhabit their borderspaces? What forms can reveal not only how form shapes content irrevocably, but also how form is inseparable from content and the larger cultural systems that constitute it? 
- how even the practice of reading is now a form of writing, now that all text is datafied and our choices are digital, social, networked. Further, all writing is read into, influenced by the algorithmic systems in which we are deeply embedded and implicated, which express in more extreme ways the influences we already bring to analog reading. 
- how algorithmic co-writing helps us find the word we're looking for even as it narrows down choices and capitalizes on the space between words. I'm interested in the natural language processing of autocomplete and text generation---in particular the human co-authors who unwitting participate when corporate interests extract their text to create machine learning models but who have no say in shaping their design or applications. As power relations are amplified, particular interests become legible or illegible as they are processed algorithmically: How does this shape the new algorithmically co-written ‘voice’ of writers?
- not only what these ML/NLP tools have to offer an expanded/obliterated definition of agency/authorship, but also how they require/inspire new experimental forms that interrogate their problematic current uses and expand their creative, even activist imaginaries through poetic practices
