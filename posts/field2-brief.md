# immersive data identities

_What does my data say about me, that I couldn't say before? That I didn't want to say? Do I wear it well_

## field brief

### area of interest, why the field matters to me

- how different specific bodies are interpellated through data gathering/processing systems as human or less-than according to neoliberal, white supremacist, patriarchal, and proprietary concerns that narrow the possibilities for being. Whether mistakenly labeled as terrorist from your cell phone’s GPS footprint or being misgendered or simply better marketed to, these identities created by data-extractive algorithmic systems, our representative ‘data bodies’,  have different material embodied stakes for different individuals. 
- this foreclosure of subject positions and modes of imagining selves and community identities is increasingly immersive and emphasized within algorithmic systems, but is informed by analog historical processes of racialization and colonialism originating in particular from the Atlantic slave trade, which by design extract bodies’ data and labor, limiting their material agency, their social imaginaries, and their lives. 
- some subversive survival strategies and analog antecedents were overshadowed when they did not map onto quantifiable data systems, but may provide alternative models with more space for plurality (e.g. paper diaries as an open interface vs a mood app with five predetermined choices as a closed interface). 
- when enacted computationally and at scale, data identities fracture and complicate the individualistic Western idea of ‘self.’ Rather, concepts of self and technology are co-extensive, continuous (a false dichotomy), calling for new understandings of identification that are temporal, performative, distributed, technophenomenological, embedded with active data, and accountable to their interrelations. If a self _is_ a technology, this allows for a critique of post/humanism and data culture that uses networked, immersive data to reveal relational intersubjectivity without flattening inequity. It calls for a broader agential ecology and an ethics of care as counter-strategies to current exploitative methods, including a reconsideration of what ‘counts’ as data and how it is owned, offered, optimized, interpreted, and embodied.
