# intersectional artificial intelligence

Field exam will appear here supplemented by the surrounding pages. Watch the livestream and refresh this page to read along.



Wernimont uses the metaphor of the matrices as “the media in which something is generated or developed. As a generative form, the matrix is a powerful way of understanding and critiquing binary logics and simple, progressive narratives” (11). Citing Vivian M. May, she says it also grounds intersectional practice and thought, “intersectional work focuses on 'enmeshed multiplicities,' including but not limited to those of race and gender. It also entails a commitment to ‘resistant forms of knowing’ [...]. The matrix logic of intersectional feminism ‘considers how inequalities intermingle,’ and stresses linkages between ‘the structural and experiential, and the material and the discursive’” (Wernimont 2018, 11).

>"But how can we define a ritual as ancient as the Agnicayana as algorithmic? To many, it may appear an act of cultural appropriation to read ancient cultures through the paradigm of the latest technologies. Nevertheless, claiming that abstract techniques of knowledge and artificial metalanguages belong uniquely to the modern industrial West is not only historically inaccurate but also an act and one of implicit _epistemic colonialism_ towards cultures of other places and other times. The French mathematician Jean-Luc Chabert has noted that “algorithms have been around since the beginning of time and existed well before a special word had been coined to describe them. Algorithms are simply a set of step by step instructions, to be carried out quite mechanically, so as to achieve some desired result.” Today some may see algorithms as a recent technological innovation implementing abstract mathematical principles. On the contrary, algorithms are among the most ancient and material practices, predating many human tools and all modern machines" (Pasquinelli 2019)
