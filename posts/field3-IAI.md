# intersectional artificial intelligence

#### exam question

This question invites you to sketch a toolkit, guide, or handbook for the advocacy argument made by this list. You write that, “less-biased technologies, intersectional ethics and approaches should be embedded at every level, from software and hardware development to implementation and to the audiences they serve.” How, concretely, should this be proposition be realized? How can the manifesto for intersectional AI be translated into practice? Alternately, describe a representative set of attempts to illuminate and/or redress the biases embedded in machine learning systems that you find meaningful or that do some of the work you envision.

## introduction: intersectional AI toolkits & a note on form

What follows on this and the related pages will be sketches for a small library of digital-print hybrid zines about Intersectional AI. Written for a non-academic audience, they are intended as practical introductory field guides to some of the theoretical concepts but primarily offering strategies and resources as a jumping off point for readers' own practice and inspiration. They will take the rhetorical tone, style, and aesthetic approaches of zines, in that they cite, quote, remix, and reframe existing materials in (hopefully) clear, plain, concise language. 

Ideally, in keeping with the approaches they will describe, in future drafts they would be developed collaboratively by multiple authors. Such work could be an ongoing project for Creative Code Collective, both as a learning tool for students who build the digital zines and as a resource for later student readers. The concept is inspired by and adapts CSS from [zine-machine.glitch.me](https://zine-machine.glitch.me/) and is also inspired by the [Tiny Tech Zines](https://www.instagram.com/tinytechzines/) festival and two fantastic zines I acquired there ["Bite-Size Networking"](https://wizardzines.com/) by Julia Evans and ["How to Cite Like a Badass Feminist Tech Scholar of Color"](https://points.datasociety.net/how-to-cite-like-a-badass-tech-feminist-scholar-of-color-ebc839a3619c) by Data and Society's Rigoberto Lara Guzmán and Sareeta Amrute. Another great zine is ["Characteristics of White Supremacy Culture"](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/uploads/4/3/5/7/43579015/zine_02.pdf) by [Tema Okun](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/white-supremacy-culture.html). 

Christina Dunbar-Hester, in _Hacking Diversity_ (2020), notes that the perhaps surprising appearance of zines and crafting in feminist technology circles makes sense: "In feminist zine making, forms of knowledge like folk medicine  can be filtered through the riot grrrl practice of zine-making, which is itself connected to long traditions of feminine papercraft and journaling. They are identity practices in addition to circulations of knowledge" (111).

# why intersectional AI? moiré as a way of seeing

["How is AI shifting power?"](nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02003-2) This is the most important question to ask, rather than is this technology biased, fair, or good, says [Pratyusha Ria Kalluri](http://riakalluri.com/). They are a founder of the Radical AI Network and an AI researcher working on "ai and art that antioppressive and queerly beautiful."

### intersectionality is (and isn't)

As I've written [elsewhere](), Intersectionality is often misunderstood: In its original formulation, says Brittney Cooper (2016), it was not merely shorthand for discussing individual identity representation in strings of hyphenates. This has allowed for further marketing to these granular categories. Rather, intersectionality is about power: It examines and critiques systems of power and how those systems structure themselves to impact groups and individuals unequally: 

"Key to the idea of intersectionality is that it does not only describe the intersecting aspects of any particular person’s identity (or positionalities, as they are sometimes termed). It also describes the intersecting forces of privilege and oppression at work in a given society. Oppression involves the systematic mistreatment of certain groups of people by other groups. It happens when power is not distributed equally” (D'Ignazio and Klein 2019, 7–8)

Wernimont uses the metaphor of matrices as "the media in which something is generated or developed. As a generative form, the matrix is a powerful way of understanding and critiquing binary logics and simple, progressive narratives" (11). Citing Vivian M. May, she says it also grounds intersectional practice and thought, "intersectional work focuses on 'enmeshed multiplicities,' including but not limited to those of race and gender. It also entails a commitment to 'resistant forms of knowing' [...]. The matrix logic of intersectional feminism 'considers how inequalities intermingle,' and stresses linkages between 'the structural and experiential, and the material and the discursive'" (Wernimont 2018, 11). 

>"simply insisting on the fluidity of racial categories or "deconstructing" assumptions is not enough. [...] Although this work in intersectionality is important, it is not enough, especially since intersectionality, as mentioned earlier, is exactly what “proxy factors” target, and also because this work still assumes homophily, but at different “ethnic” levels.” (Chun/Pattern 2018, 85).

>“Network science [...] valorizes consensus, balance, and “comfort”: it validates and assumes segregation by focusing on individual “preference,” rather than institutional constraints and racism” (Chun/Pattern 2018, 75).

#### don't want inclusion
>“Like the pre-multicultural art world of the early 80's, the new high-tech art world assumed an unquestionable "center", and drew a dramatic digital border. And on the other side of the tracks, there lived all the techno-illiterate (and underfunded) artists, along with most women, Chicanos, Afro-Americans and Native Americans. Those of us living South of the digital border were forced to assume once again the unpleasant but necessary roles of undocumented immigrants, cultural invaders, techno-pirates, and virtual coyotes (smugglers).”

>“We are no longer trying to persuade anyone that we are worthy of inclusion(we are de facto insiders/outsiders at the same time, or temporary insiders perhaps, and we know it). [...] What we wish is to remap the hegemonic cartography of cyberspace; to "politicize" the debate; to develop a multi centric theoretical understanding of the cultural, political and aesthetic possibilities of new technologies; to exchange a different sort of information (mytho poetical, activist, per formative, imagistic); and to hopefully do all this with humor and intelligence. Chicano artists in particular wish to "brownify" virtual space; to "spanglishize the net", and "infect" the lingua franca;” “to find innovative grassroots applications to new technologies;” (Gomez-Peña)

#### why not just diversity

#### alternate histories & approaches 

>"But how can we define a ritual as ancient as the Agnicayana as algorithmic? To many, it may appear an act of cultural appropriation to read ancient cultures through the paradigm of the latest technologies. 
>"Nevertheless, claiming that abstract techniques of knowledge and artificial metalanguages belong uniquely to the modern industrial West is not only historically inaccurate but also an act and one of implicit _epistemic colonialism_ towards cultures of other places and other times. The French mathematician Jean-Luc Chabert has noted that “algorithms have been around since the beginning of time and existed well before a special word had been coined to describe them. Algorithms are simply a set of step by step instructions, to be carried out quite mechanically, so as to achieve some desired result.” Today some may see algorithms as a recent technological innovation implementing abstract mathematical principles. On the contrary, algorithms are among the most ancient and material practices, predating many human tools and all modern machines" (Pasquinelli 2019)

<section class="zine-page page-5" markdown="1">

#### where algorithms & AI affect us
>“Data for Black Lives co-founder Yeshimabeit Milner reminds us that “[t]he decision to make every Black life count as three-fifths of a person was embedded in the electoral college, an algorithm that continues to be the basis of our current democracy.”” (Benjamin 2019, 5) “even just deciding what problem needs solving requires a host of judgments” (5)
“tech fixes often hide, speed up, and even deepen discrimination, while appearing to be neutral or benevolent when compared to the racism of a previous era” (Benjamin 2019, 4) 
“Codes are both reflective and predictive. They have a past and a future.” (Benjamin 2019, 3) 

#### whiteness and AI
>“what appears to be an absence in terms of being “cultureless” works more like a superpower. Invisibility, with regard to Whiteness, offers immunity. To be unmarked by race allows you to reap the benefits but escape responsibility for your role in an unjust system” (Benjamin 2019, 2) 
“The view that “technology is a neutral tool” ignores how race also functions like a tool, structuring whose literal voice gets embodied in AI. In celebrating diversity, tokenistic approaches to tech development fail to acknowledge how the White aesthetic colors AI. The “blandness” of Whiteness [...] is treated by programmers as normal, universal, and appealing.” (Benjamin 2019, 15)

### restorative processing - call to action, infrastructures of care

it's not just about bias but more broadly about care. For what and for whom do we truly care? And how do we demonstrate those values by where we orient (after Ahmed) ourselves, our attention, our resources? Along with all of the harm caused by technological and cultural bias, framing these issues in the positive rather than the negative makes this a question not just of what to remove but what to build in its place. 


### queer affects

>"there is a dynamic of connection and interaction on Tumblr based on a nonlinear, atemporal rhizomal exchange of affect and sensation, a 'queer reverb' of repeat and repeat; and there may be a possibility for this sort of transmission to buoy an antinormative or resistant politics” (Cho 47)
"if queer temporality is the condition, then refrain is the mechanics" (Cho 52). 

>“If constant connectivity provides us with a relational norm of sorts, then disconnection could function as a queer orientation device with the potential of creating openings for other ways of coming together, and other ways of staying together.” (64)
>“Once we conceptualise or otherwise sense how the break, or the possibility of a break, is that which makes the signal, something happens to how relations can be conceived, and how they might feel. Disconnection, as something that lives within every connection, as the backbone of connectivity, may help us rethink connectedness and relations on a fundamental affective level. Put differently, the vulnerability and disruptive quality of digital media can help us envision modes of being together in ways that challenge the norm of uninterrupted connectivity and relatedness. The break may not be the end, but a new beginning. The disconnect may not lessen, but intensify the connection, as well as open up for other connections, in parallel.” (73)

Citing several artists and scholars, Jacob Gabory points to "queer opacity [or] queer darkness as not only an aesthetic but an ethos" (Gaboury 2018, 148)

"not a politics of resistance but a refusal of the very terms of engagement." (Gaboury 2018, 149)

"how can we enact disappearance in such a way that does not erase difference?" (Gaboury 2018, 147). Gaboury calls for "forms of life that account for refusal as a situated practice---one that is explicitly raced and embodied, even as it would prefer not to articulate the situatedness of any single identity form." (Gaboury 2018, 148)

### AI TO DO LIST <!--could repeat or put at end of zine1-->
**What to know about Intersectional AI (see volume 1)**
  - know it's about power
  - stay self-reflexive, polyvocal, multimodal
  - add back error, uncertainty, entanglement
  - combine tech & culture/discourse
  - entwine data, design, & community
  - embrace a meta ethics of multiplicity & relation
- decenter neoliberalism and European knowledge (and its own stories about its histories)
- dedigitize where possible, what analog tools can help do the job just as well or help in the moment
- infrastructures of care: mutual aid and prioritizing slowness and care over speed and career
- go where the people are, the audience is not in silicon valley

### values

#### anti-white-supremacist
Another great zine, ["Characteristics of White Supremacy Culture"](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/uploads/4/3/5/7/43579015/zine_02.pdf) by [Tema Okun](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/white-supremacy-culture.html), outlines traits that permate culture that we want to avoid in designing and implementing intersectional tech:
  - perfectionism
  - urgency
  - defensiveness
  - quantity before quality
  - worship of the written word
  - only one right way
  - paternalism
  - either/or thinking
  - power hoarding
  - fear of conflict
  - individualism
  - progress as bigger/more
  - objectivity
  - right to comfort
  
Some of the values of organizations that support intersectional technologies that try to operate against white supremacy have included **rest, asking questions not assuming knowledge, 

MA+P's Creative Code Collective values include (and we continue to develop these in community) "cooperation not competition, scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code, open-source first, do-it-together, project-based and project-oriented, growth not perfection."

#### feminist handmade media practices, ai as craft 
iteration, exploration, slow, embodied, specific/situated

### making 
"how to write nonviolent creative code: honor the land, honor the body, honor the small, honor the exchange" [p5.js Contributors Conference](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19xxc2zWWdFMAQjT6tRdN5ZU13vAKSwM7jojaC2U4F6Q/edit#slide=id.g5fc8f78ea6_1_99)

#### Critical Code Studies


#### Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's 7 Tenants of Data Feminism :
  1. examine power
  1. challenge power
  1. elevate emotion and embodiment, valuing multiple forms of knowledge
  1. rethink binaries and hierarchies
  1. embrace multiple perspectives, prioritizing local, indigenous, and experiential knowing
  1. consider context: "data are not neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social relations, and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical analysis"
  1. make labor visible so it can be valued
  
#### design for a feminist server (Dunbar-Hester 2020, 113--114)
Because it offers material access and control, running a "feminist server" can be a form of activism. "For example, on the radical left, the group Riseup devotes server space to mirroring content for social justice organizations on at least three continents" (113). Some of the "principles for design and operation" include:
  - is a situated technology, in context, part of an ecology of practice

#### how ~~not~~ to structure your organization

Tips from _Hacking Diversity_ by Christina Dunbar-Hester:

_But I want everyone to feel good, so no one should be in charge, right?_
>Rather than "shelving hierarchy entirely," many BIPOC and LGBTQ/feminist hackerspaces prefer "an accountable, transparent hierarchy" that is "as horizontal and distributed as possible, instead of having unofficial leaders "who govern through "charisma, reputational capital or technical prowess. [...] A culture of valorizing technology itself, and especially granting certain people star status through their technical prowess and willingness to claim credit for technical accomplishments, [is] part of the problem" (89).

_Should I work within existing systems, structures, organizations, or create your own?_ 
>"Many advocates pursue both mainstream intervention and separate spaces simultaneously, recognizing that each has utility and that it is not an either/or situation" (70).

_What's important to know in working with others?_
>Prioritize clear documentation (and other skills valued besides just 'hard coding') and "collectivized communicability" as part of your politics (82--83).

_Isn't the barrier to entry to high to even try?_
>"[It's] 'not patronizing to meet people where they're at. [...] Find a device you already use, take out the proprietary crap that controls it, and control it yourself'" (108).

### Types of Creative-Critical-Code Interventions: What can you imagine?
  - **Inform:** provide or reveal information that already exists or is hidden
  - **Challenge:** disrupt, troll, converse, intervene, activate, ask questions
  - **Reimagine:** redesign, reframe, recontextualize, sketch out
  - **Reflect:** aesthetic, artistic, affective, contemplative, essayistic
  - **Resource:** convene, make space, provide access, provide goods or services, teach or share, ask (someone else might need the same thing)

>"a project may be feminist in content, in that it challenges power by choice of subject matter; in form, in that it challenges power by shifting the aesthetic and/or sensory registers of data communication; and/or in process, in that it challenges power by building participatory, inclusive processes of knowledge production. What unites this broad scope of data-based work is a commitment to action and a desire to remake the world." (D'Ignazio and Klein 18)

>“Database design, in that way, is “an exercise in worldbuilding,” a normative process in which programmers are in a position to project their world views---a process that all too often reproduces the technology of race.” (Benjamin 2019, 54)
