# intersectional artificial intelligence

#### exam question

This question invites you to sketch a toolkit, guide, or handbook for the advocacy argument made by this list. You write that, “less-biased technologies, intersectional ethics and approaches should be embedded at every level, from software and hardware development to implementation and to the audiences they serve.” How, concretely, should this be proposition be realized? How can the manifesto for intersectional AI be translated into practice? Alternately, describe a representative set of attempts to illuminate and/or redress the biases embedded in machine learning systems that you find meaningful or that do some of the work you envision.

## introduction: intersectional AI toolkit library, as a form

What follows on this and the related pages are sketches for a small library of digital-print hybrid zines about Intersectional AI. Written for a non-academic audience, they are intended as practical introductory field guides to some of the theoretical concepts but primarily offering strategies and resources as a jumping off point for readers' own practice and inspiration. They will take the rhetorical tone, style, and aesthetic approaches of zines, in that they cite, quote, remix, and reframe existing materials in (hopefully) clear, plain, concise language. This is in keeping with the multimodal and polyvocal approaches I have previously identified as intersectional.[^citar]

[^citar]: [Ciston, Sarah. 2019. "Intersectional AI Is Essential](http://artes.ucp.pt/citarj/article/view/665){:target="_blank"}

Ideally, in keeping with the approaches they will describe, in future drafts this zine collection would be developed collaboratively by multiple authors. Such work could be an ongoing project for Creative Code Collective, both as a learning tool for students who research, code, and compose the digital zines and as also as a resource for later student who read or adapt them. The concept is inspired by and adapts CSS from [zine-machine.glitch.me](https://zine-machine.glitch.me/){:target="_blank"}  and is also inspired by the [Tiny Tech Zines](https://www.instagram.com/tinytechzines/){:target="_blank"} festival and two fantastic zines I acquired there ["Bite-Size Networking"](https://wizardzines.com/){:target="_blank"} by Julia Evans and ["How to Cite Like a Badass Feminist Tech Scholar of Color"](https://points.datasociety.net/how-to-cite-like-a-badass-tech-feminist-scholar-of-color-ebc839a3619c){:target="_blank"} by Data and Society's Rigoberto Lara Guzmán and Sareeta Amrute. Another great zine is ["Characteristics of White Supremacy Culture"](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/uploads/4/3/5/7/43579015/zine_02.pdf){:target="_blank"} by [Tema Okun](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/white-supremacy-culture.html){:target="_blank"} and ["The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observation."](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e3/The_Techno-Galactic_Guide_to_Software_Observation_2018.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

Christina Dunbar-Hester, in _Hacking Diversity_ (2020), notes that the perhaps surprising appearance of zines and crafting in feminist technology circles makes sense: "In feminist zine making, forms of knowledge like folk medicine  can be filtered through the riot grrrl practice of zine-making, which is itself connected to long traditions of feminine papercraft and journaling. They are identity practices in addition to circulations of knowledge" (111). As digital-print hybrids, they can utilize the liveliest aspects of both: GIFS and images, the expandability and nonlinearity of hyperlinks, and other dynamic content online; but also the accessible, 'handmade', distributable, low-power novelty of paper at a moment of maximum screen fatigue. The print versions of these zines are formatted to print double-sided on a single 8.5x11" landscape page, making reversible two-part mini-zines (in multiple combinations as the library grows). 

In _Living a Feminist Life_, Sara Ahmed outlines "A Killjoy Survival Kit," which she says should contain books, things, tools, time, life, permission notes, other killjoys, humor, feelings, bodies, and your own survival kit (235--249). A "Toolkit for Intersectional AI" is both inspired by the kind of cooperative survival she calls for--"Protest can be a form of self-care as well as care for others: a refusal not to matter. Self-care can also be those ordinary ways we look out for each other [...] in queer, feminist, and antiracist work, self-care is about the creation of community, fragile communities [...] assembled out of the experiences of being shattered. We reassemble ourselves through the ordinary, everyday, and often painstaking work of looking after ourselves; looking after each other." (240)--and the toolkit I begin to imagine here is something I would want in my own survival kit, and something I hope others would want in theirs, too.

[**"How is AI shifting power?"**](nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02003-2){:target="_blank"} 

This is the most important question to ask, rather than is this technology biased, fair, or good, says [Pratyusha Ria Kalluri](http://riakalluri.com/){:target="_blank"}. They are a founder of the Radical AI Network and an AI researcher working on "ai and art that antioppressive and queerly beautiful."

#### what intersectionality is (and isn't), what it can offer tech

Intersectionality is often misunderstood: In its original formulation by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, says Brittney Cooper (2016), it was not merely shorthand for discussing individual identity representation. Critics point out how this has allowed for even more granular marketing to these categories as they become visible to and targeted by capitalism (Chun 2018, 85). Rather, intersectionality is about power. It examines and critiques systems of power and how those systems structure themselves to impact groups and individuals unequally. Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein (2019) agree that intersectionality not only describes different aspects of an individual's position, but also "intersecting forces of privilege and oppression at work in a given society. Oppression involves the systematic mistreatment of certain groups of people by other groups. It happens when power is not distributed equally” (7–-8). Intersectional feminism insists on not just meeting the needs of the most priviledged (white) women when arguing for feminism, or the needs of only Black men when combating anti-Blackness, but instead suggests that those with overlapping oppressions such as Black women face unique additional oppression; by addressing their circumstances, for example, life improves for everyone. 

Jacqueline Wernimont (2018) uses the metaphor of a matrix, as in, "the media in which something is generated or developed. As a generative form, the matrix is a powerful way of understanding and critiquing binary logics and simple, progressive narratives" (11). Citing Vivian M. May, she says it also grounds intersectional practice and thought, "intersectional work focuses on 'enmeshed multiplicities,' including but not limited to those of race and gender. It also entails a commitment to 'resistant forms of knowing' [...]. The matrix logic of intersectional feminism 'considers how inequalities intermingle,' and stresses linkages between 'the structural and experiential, and the material and the discursive'" (11). This suggests how intersectionality could offer a different lens through which to approach AI and technology in general. Intersectional AI as sketched out here is indebted to Crenshaw's original definition, as well as the concept's long lineages within Black and indigenous thought, for its critical lens to analyze technology and for its creative approach to redesigning it.[^more]

<!-- [A matrix material can be the support for intersecting fibers...] moire, mesh net sifts sorts what stays and goes, could be the matrix what supports the new thing that emerges out of it-->

[^more]: Amelia Jones (2013) suggests a switch from thinking of fixed "identity" to instead "identification" that allows for the slippery, time-based, contingent nature of these concepts: "we must continue to acknowledge the ways in which bodies are identified and positioned in the world (including our own), while refusing to allow our assumptions about identity to congeal into fixed binaries" (6). This also resonates with Tara McPherson's (2018) idea of the "intersectional cut," which reclaims intersectionality as "a fuzzy edge and a point" (98), that is, acknowledging after Karen Barad the role of the lens in looking (and the ability to shift that lens to shift the view).

#### against inclusion, not bias, decentering instead

Guillermo Gómez-Peña says the high-tech world does not question itself as central, nor where it draws its borders: 

We are no longer trying to persuade anyone that we are worthy of inclusion (we are de facto insiders/outsiders at the same time, or temporary insiders perhaps, and we know it). [...] What we wish is to remap the hegemonic cartography of cyberspace; to "politicize" the debate; to develop a multi centric theoretical understanding of the cultural, political and aesthetic possibilities of new technologies; to exchange a different sort of information (mytho poetical, activist, per formative, imagistic); and to hopefully do all this with humor and intelligence. Chicano artists in particular wish to "brownify" virtual space; to "spanglishize the net", and "infect" the lingua franca; [...] to find innovative grassroots applications to new technologies
{: .fs-3 .purple-inline }

Lisa Nakamura, Sarah T. Roberts, and others have pointed to the many female and BIPOC tech workers who go unrecognized because their work is not the glamor work of tech, from the physically-taxing work of chip manufacturing on New Mexico reservations to the emotionally-taxing work of content moderation at sites just-off big tech campuses. Christina Dunbar-Hester (2020) argues that even "hacking has never been centered exclusively around white men in the Global North. Furthermore, some of what is required here is to simply shift the frame of what counts as hacking: to redraw boundaries to _place social and historical analysis and infrastructural care work within the purview of hacking._ In combination, these analytical adjustments can illuminate the 'others' of hacking---who are already here" (242). She adds that "diversity" fixes completely miss the problem, reversing cause and effect: "to frame social inequality as a question of diversity in technological production, and to expect to change wider inequities by adding 'diverse' individuals to technical cultures, is to misunderstand how the distribution of various social identities in a given sector are _outgrowths of differential social power_, not the other way around" (16).
 
By a similar logic, removing bias from algorithmic systems---even if that were possible (which, no.)---does not remove bias from culture, nor does it replace it with anything. Often, even well-meaning efforts to "remove" bias from systems fall back on quantitative/computational methods or resort to representation, which mirror the problems they claim to address, potentially even making tools to be misused in the future: "Representation as a goal may also result in accepting (and reproducing) notions of fixity in terms of social identity. This should raise skepticism" (236). These approaches do not examine the structure of the system itself, the logic upon which it is founded, both materially and intellectually. They do not ask who is creating, contributing, or benefitting from its operation. "Diversity [and, I argue, bias examination] is necessary, but not sufficient; it represents a shortcut in what should be a deeper conversation about values and justice" (Dunbar-Hester 2020, 241)

#### where algorithms & AI affect us

Ruja Benjamin "the New Jim Code"
>“Data for Black Lives co-founder Yeshimabeit Milner reminds us that “[t]he decision to make every Black life count as three-fifths of a person was embedded in the electoral college, an algorithm that continues to be the basis of our current democracy.”” (Benjamin 2019, 5) “even just deciding what problem needs solving requires a host of judgments” (5)
“tech fixes often hide, speed up, and even deepen discrimination, while appearing to be neutral or benevolent when compared to the racism of a previous era” (Benjamin 2019, 4) 
“Codes are both reflective and predictive. They have a past and a future.” (Benjamin 2019, 3) 

#### whiteness and AI
>“what appears to be an absence in terms of being “cultureless” works more like a superpower. Invisibility, with regard to Whiteness, offers immunity. To be unmarked by race allows you to reap the benefits but escape responsibility for your role in an unjust system” (Benjamin 2019, 2) 
“The view that “technology is a neutral tool” ignores how race also functions like a tool, structuring whose literal voice gets embodied in AI. In celebrating diversity, tokenistic approaches to tech development fail to acknowledge how the White aesthetic colors AI. The “blandness” of Whiteness [...] is treated by programmers as normal, universal, and appealing.” (Benjamin 2019, 15)

#### alternate histories & approaches 

>"But how can we define a ritual as ancient as the Agnicayana as algorithmic? To many, it may appear an act of cultural appropriation to read ancient cultures through the paradigm of the latest technologies. 
>"Nevertheless, claiming that abstract techniques of knowledge and artificial metalanguages belong uniquely to the modern industrial West is not only historically inaccurate but also an act and one of implicit _epistemic colonialism_ towards cultures of other places and other times. The French mathematician Jean-Luc Chabert has noted that “algorithms have been around since the beginning of time and existed well before a special word had been coined to describe them. Algorithms are simply a set of step by step instructions, to be carried out quite mechanically, so as to achieve some desired result.” Today some may see algorithms as a recent technological innovation implementing abstract mathematical principles. On the contrary, algorithms are among the most ancient and material practices, predating many human tools and all modern machines" (Pasquinelli 2019)

#### restorative processing - call to action, infrastructures of care

it's not just about bias but more broadly about care. For what and for whom do we truly care? And how do we demonstrate those values by where we orient (after Ahmed) ourselves, our attention, our resources? Along with all of the harm caused by technological and cultural bias, framing these issues in the positive rather than the negative makes this a question not just of what to remove but what to build in its place.

#### a better AI is possible: love notes to intersectional innovators

Besides activism like protest or critical writing, another way to make change is "argument by technology"---aka making stuff---or even "hacks of open-technology communities themselves, which directly flow from practitioners' habit of reflective technical engagement" (Dunbar-Hester 2020, 50).

#### ethics approaches inspired by Black feminism, womanism, queer of color feminism (?) & values, tactics
ethics & tactics

"the strategies employed by women of color are at the core of an intersectional critical praxis. Noble, Brendesha Tynes, and Joshua Schuschke (2016) argue that the queer women of color who founded Black Lives Matter offer a model for coalition-building through skills honed in community: QUOTE “the movement’s reﬂexivity, the ability to counter hegemonic narratives, and self-care are key components of digital intersectionality. By modeling the standard of reﬂexivity, the movement is able to critique and correct its own narrative and practices” (28).

These could be incorporated into intersectional AI at the development, implementation, analysis, or data-gathering stages—and these methods could work to destabilize existing standards and biases.

In particular, strategies from mixed race, trans, bisexual, and femme communities—whose identities are not easily categorized, who sometimes maneuver by passing within systems—may also help engage and subvert normative algorithmic practices, operating on multiple valences of infrastructural power and intersectional disenfranchisement."

#### anti-white-supremacist
Another great zine, ["Characteristics of White Supremacy Culture"](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/uploads/4/3/5/7/43579015/zine_02.pdf){:target="_blank"} by [Tema Okun](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/white-supremacy-culture.html){:target="_blank"}, outlines traits that permate culture that we want to avoid in designing and implementing intersectional tech:
  - ~~perfectionism~~
  - ~~urgency~~
  - ~~defensiveness~~
  - ~~quantity before quality~~
  - ~~worship of the written word~~
  - ~~only one right way~~
  - ~~paternalism~~

#### queer aesthetics, ethics, tactics
#### queer affects: null, break, reverb

Choosing when passing/flagging (not an option for everyone)

>"there is a dynamic of connection and interaction on Tumblr based on a nonlinear, atemporal rhizomal exchange of affect and sensation, a 'queer reverb' of repeat and repeat; and there may be a possibility for this sort of transmission to buoy an antinormative or resistant politics” (Cho 47)
"if queer temporality is the condition, then refrain is the mechanics" (Cho 52). 

>“If constant connectivity provides us with a relational norm of sorts, then disconnection could function as a queer orientation device with the potential of creating openings for other ways of coming together, and other ways of staying together.” (64)
>“Once we conceptualise or otherwise sense how the break, or the possibility of a break, is that which makes the signal, something happens to how relations can be conceived, and how they might feel. Disconnection, as something that lives within every connection, as the backbone of connectivity, may help us rethink connectedness and relations on a fundamental affective level. Put differently, the vulnerability and disruptive quality of digital media can help us envision modes of being together in ways that challenge the norm of uninterrupted connectivity and relatedness. The break may not be the end, but a new beginning. The disconnect may not lessen, but intensify the connection, as well as open up for other connections, in parallel.” (73)

Citing several artists and scholars, Jacob Gabory points to "queer opacity [or] queer darkness as not only an aesthetic but an ethos" (Gaboury 2018, 148)

"not a politics of resistance but a refusal of the very terms of engagement." (Gaboury 2018, 149)

"how can we enact disappearance in such a way that does not erase difference?" (Gaboury 2018, 147). Gaboury calls for "forms of life that account for refusal as a situated practice---one that is explicitly raced and embodied, even as it would prefer not to articulate the situatedness of any single identity form." (Gaboury 2018, 148)

"NULL in the relational model is not a synonym for an empty string or the numerical value 0. While the number 0 would indicate an explicit lack of some quantiﬁable thing, and therefore be numerically meaningful in the calculation of a given value, NULL indicates the absence of any value whatsoever, such that linguistically it is not considered a value at all, but rather a “marker” that indicates a state of indeterminacy." (Gaboury 2018, 152)

"The use of NULL thus marks an indeterminate mode of being that is at once within and outside, part of and illegible to a discrete system of relations, a “middle” that explicitly marks an indeterminate, incalculable, unknown state of being." (Gaboury 2018, 153)

"the NULL marker corresponds with the epistemological condition of queerness as an excessive illegibility collapsed into an unwieldy frame, an aberrant third-ness within an otherwise normative system of relations. In this sense, NULL is not a state of being, but rather a mode of relation invested in the production of unknowable markers, a practice of becoming." (Gaboury 2018, 153)

"Centering black[^black data] and queer life [...] offers a radical reformulation of the subtractive mode offered by the NULL marker as a technological form, that is, as a tactic of negotiated visibility that removes itself from the productive logic of the system that would seek to identify it." (Gaboury 2018, 154)

[^black data]: Gaboury cites Shaka McGlotten's concept of 'black data', and the dehumanization of black and queer life to construct and stabilize the white political techno subject,  which I want to read up on next.

Some of the values of organizations that support intersectional technologies that try to operate against white supremacy have included **rest, asking questions not assuming knowledge, 

MA+P's Creative Code Collective values include (and we continue to develop these in community) "cooperation not competition, scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code, open-source first, do-it-together, project-based and project-oriented, growth not perfection."

#### feminist handmade media practices, ai as craft 
iteration, exploration, slow, embodied, specific/situated

#### Critical Code Studies


#### Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's 7 Tenants of Data Feminism :
  1. examine power
  1. challenge power
  1. elevate emotion and embodiment, valuing multiple forms of knowledge
  1. rethink binaries and hierarchies
  1. embrace multiple perspectives, prioritizing local, indigenous, and experiential knowing
  1. consider context: "data are not neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social relations, and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical analysis"
  1. make labor visible so it can be valued
  
#### design for a feminist server (anarchoserver.org via Dunbar-Hester 2020, 113--114)
Because it offers material access and control, running a "feminist server" can be a form of activism. "For example, on the radical left, the group Riseup devotes server space to mirroring content for social justice organizations on at least three continents" (113). Some of the "principles for design and operation" include:
  - is a situated technology, in context, part of an ecology of practice
  - run by and for a caring community
  - builds on the materiality of software, hardware, and the bodies gathered around it
  - exposes processes, tools, sources, habits, patterns
  - does not strive for seamlessness (not transparent as in invisible)
  - avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scaleability, and immediacy because they can be traps
  - knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, paracitic practice
  - decides her own dependencies
  - questions the conditions for servicing and service, experiments with changing client-server relations
  - wants mutable, read-write accessible networks
  - does not confuse safety with security, risks exposing her insecurity
  - tries not to apologize when she is unavailable

#### how ~~not~~ to structure your organization

Tips from _Hacking Diversity_ by Christina Dunbar-Hester:

_But I want everyone to feel good, so no one should be in charge, right?_
>Rather than "shelving hierarchy entirely," many BIPOC and LGBTQ/feminist hackerspaces prefer "an accountable, transparent hierarchy" that is "as horizontal and distributed as possible, instead of having unofficial leaders "who govern through "charisma, reputational capital or technical prowess. [...] A culture of valorizing technology itself, and especially granting certain people star status through their technical prowess and willingness to claim credit for technical accomplishments, [is] part of the problem" (89).

_Should I work within existing systems, structures, organizations, or create your own?_ 
>"Many advocates pursue both mainstream intervention and separate spaces simultaneously, recognizing that each has utility and that it is not an either/or situation" (70).

_What's important to know in working with others?_
>Prioritize clear documentation (and other skills valued besides just 'hard coding') and "collectivized communicability" as part of your politics (82--83).

_Isn't the barrier to entry to high to even try?_
>"[It's] 'not patronizing to meet people where they're at. [...] Find a device you already use, take out the proprietary crap that controls it, and control it yourself'" (108).

#### Types of Creative-Critical-Code Interventions: What can you imagine?
  - **Inform:** provide or reveal information that already exists or is hidden
  - **Challenge:** disrupt, troll, converse, intervene, activate, ask questions
  - **Reimagine:** redesign, reframe, recontextualize, sketch out
  - **Reflect:** aesthetic, artistic, affective, contemplative, essayistic
  - **Resource:** convene, make space, provide access, provide goods or services, teach or share, ask (someone else might need the same thing)

"Database design, in that way, is “an exercise in worldbuilding,” a normative process in which programmers are in a position to project their world views---a process that all too often reproduces the technology of race." --Ruja Benjamin, _Race After Technology_ (54)
{: .fs-3 .purple-inline }

"a project may be feminist in content, in that it challenges power by choice of subject matter; in form, in that it challenges power by shifting the aesthetic and/or sensory registers of data communication; and/or in process, in that it challenges power by building participatory, inclusive processes of knowledge production. What unites this broad scope of data-based work is a commitment to action and a desire to remake the world." --Catherine D'Ignazio & Lauren Klein, _Data Feminism_ (18)
