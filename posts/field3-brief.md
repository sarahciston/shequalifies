# intersectional artificial intelligence

_How can we make artificial intelligence more equitable and less biased by drawing on its counter-histories and alternative uses, and by reimagining it through intersectional tactics and theories at every level?_

## field brief

### area of interest, why the field matters to me

- the popular literature is catching on that automated systems skew to existing power, and I’ve written elsewhere on how AI should be critiqued using intersectionality as both a critical lens and a mode of praxis. To take it further here, I’m interested in how Intersectional AI is made: how it is taken up by current makers and collectives, which principles and practices guide its creation and application, what counter-histories/counter-imaginaries offer counter-trajectories to the present assumptions about what automated systems must do (namely to categorize difference, to map its patterns, but only those which can be reduced to the computable). 
-  imagine AI systems and their supporting infrastructures instead informed by Black, indigenous, POC, queer, feminist ways of knowing, their long histories of handmade media and craft techniques and aesthetics, their communities of care, their strategies for passing and flagging and for surviving violent systems. 
- an intersectional stack(s) (wouldn’t be called a stack but) would originate from and serve the needs of its own communities; would understand its material relationships as an ecology; would embrace error, delay, and ambiguity; and would not try to be everything to everyone. It would value multiplicity, interrelation, polyvocality, multimodality. in my own practice, I’m interested in what critical-creative-code-community modalities can produce this kind of work, or document its iterative and instinctual naturess, or create shared spaces that support its generation. More broadly, I argue for an essential relationship between experimental artistic-research and tactical-media approaches like this and larger-scale real-world applications.

### organizing metaphors & verbs
moiré, intersecting lines that create energy beyond the surface of the page, drawn out from and supported by the matrix of orientations and alterity, community and conflict. moiré is a different relationship to pattern than standard AI thinking, knowing that these patterns are created illusions allows us to think of them more creatively and playfully. what can these patterns do, how do they effect power relationships, rather than letting them fix individuals in one place for their exploitation or abuse. 

passing (& flagging) bi/femme/mixed
bot, ladymouth, tactical media tools
matrix as opposed to stack for the network infrastructure
