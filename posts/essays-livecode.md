# creative-critical-code writing

Writing with, writing through, writing during, writing as code, encoded and recoding. 

Combines critical code, creative writing, creative coding, arts-based research, making and using tools at the same time (creating what you need on the fly, imagining the form to pour content into/as they are inseperable).

How does this compare to other platforms? It's not a live music performance. It allows for process-oriented methods, less-perfectionist/academic/white-supremacist?

How does this shift access/code literacy approaches? Someone using their tools rather than just here's a tool and a textbook, here are non-normative uses, you might not do this one, but opens the field for others. Authorship, anyone can check in on process/progress of ideas. 

How does this shift essay writing: affordances like color coding, exposing the platform of the 'word processor' and its defaults
