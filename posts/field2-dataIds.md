# immersive data identities

#### exam question

In this section you ask (as a parenthetical “bonus” question) why data extracted and produced in the course of everyday engagements with “algorithmic systems” should even be called “’mine,’ given their complicated histories, trajectories, and impacts?” I’m particularly interested here in their “histories,” which encompass in your argument both extreme brutality (e.g. quantitative techniques developed within the transatlantic slave trade) and more “subversive” possibilities (you give the example here of paper diaries). I would like to hear much more from you about historical antecedents to contemporary hybrid (creative/critical/technical) practices and how they both blur into and are distinct from those practices. I would especially like to hear, time permitting, about how “overshadowed” forms (like diaries, among others) might have informed your own creative practice, or that of your artistic contemporaries. **also not unrelated:** What does an arts-based approach bring to the discussion of data and self, and what specific critique or subversive strategy can it provide to the datafied subject and data colonialism? **and:** from the first use of personal sensor data in human performance to more recent use for recommendation systems and the eventual appearance of what has been called the 'algorithmic self.'

## 0. introduction: know yourself vs take care of yourself

>"Know thyself has long been cover for self-regulation and wealth generation in the service of the nation-state and other institutional entities. [...] Knowing thyself looks an awful lot like corporate efforts to know and shape the consumer body" (Jacqueline Wernimont 2018, 155, 155).
{: .fs-3 }

>"In Greek and Roman texts, the injunction of having to know yourself was always associated with the other principle of having to take care of yourself. [...] "There has been an inversion between the hierarchy of the two principles of antiquity, 'Take care of yourself' and 'Know thyself.' In Greco-Roman culture knowledge of oneself appeared as the consequence of taking care of yourself. In the modern world, knowledge of oneself constitutes the fundamental principle." (Michel Foucault 1988, 20, 22)
{: .fs-3 }    
    
    "I received an email telling me it was over. 
    I didn’t know how to respond 
    It was almost as if it hadn’t been meant for me. 
    It ended with the words, Take care of yourself.
    I followed this advice to the letter
    I asked 107 women (as well as two handpuppets and a parrot), chosen for their profession or skills, to interpret the letter.
    To analyse it, comment on it, dance it, sing it. Dissect it. Exhaust it.
    Understand it for me. Answer for me.
    It was a way of taking the time to break up
    A way to take care of myself." (Sophie Calle 2007, #datacollection)

The data body, a term first popularized by Critical Art Ensemble (1998), which called it the 'fascist sibling' of the virtual body (145), is now marketed to serve as an anticipatory recommendation engine who knows you better than you do, "a form of algorithmic proprioception, an expansion of the self, enabled by physical and cognitive sensors and feedback loops” (Finn 2017, 77). The convenience of this (proposed) service is how all manner of intimacy breeches and unethical oversteps inch into users' lives, as frogs immersed in a soup of their own data. This is not a warm bath of self-care, measured in meditation minutes, but an uncontrollable roiling boil.

How do I know if I've lost feeling in my data body, and what even is data anyway? There's too much of it to bother knowing what it is, but Miriam Posner and Lauren Klein (2017) build on definitions by Christine Borgman and Daniel Rosenberg to argue that, in addition to being "contingent and time-based" as well as "_specifically_ rhetorical," they add "categorization and computability" (1). Importantly, Posner and Klein call data as much an orientation to source material as a kind of knowlege (2). What's interesting about this is the whole point of data now is to sound not-contingent but fixed, not-rhetorical but indesputable---oozing with Truthiness. And this orientation to knowledge joins us from, yes, probably as early as the Enlightenment--because science! You probably know the rest.

Along the way we'll cover why your iPhone isn't as sassy or as useful in the trenches as it ought to be, whether a 1983 computer is better at your feelings than you are, the importance of critical biometric consciousness, why donating your data is better extraction, how to heal from data trauma, and some of the strategies that might help us escape data colonialism---namely: embodiment, adaptability, access, communities of care.

Étienne-Jules Marey is a prominent figure in the story of the long histories of violence emerging from the colonialist impulses toward classification, datification, taxonomy, encyclopedic knowledge, and ownership. In 1859, he invented the sphygmograph, a direct indexical measure of the rhythms of bloodflow---from wrist to stylus to carbon (Osman 2019, 13). His sphygmograph sounds like something to be cleaned up later and appears like a clackering stigmata against the vulnerable pulse point inside the wrist. Meanwhile his other chronolocomotive tools built to capture motion otherwise imperceptible to the eye resemble guns and a 19th-century FitBit torture device.

As precursors to the contemporary data devices we enjoy and are annoyed by today, these objects are oft cited when sketching the history of wearable technology and personal data. But the story goes back much further and persists in todays materials, practices, and concerns, however invisibly embedded and embodied. 

The ability and interest in classification and differentiation of people was (and is) directly tied to the project of oppression. As Alexander Weheliye (2014) frames it, race is created for racism---and declared 'natural' to justify its violence: “the biopolitical function of race is racism” (42). He details how this project categorizes state subjects into degrees of human, using categories of non-human to do so: "Despite having no real basis in biochemistry, the hieroglyphics of the flesh requires grounding in the biological sphere so as to facilitate—even as it conceals and because it masks—the political, economic, social, and cultural disciplining (semiosis of procedure) of the Homo sapiens species into assemblages of the human, not-quite-human, and nonhuman; this is what I am referring to as racialization" (33).

As new practices of digital data collection increase at-scale, the extractive practices of colonialism are also amplified. Deborah Lupton (2020) discussion of "data selves" pins it down neatly, although she does not go so far as to tie it to race directly: "As part of automated decision-making regimes, data are exploited to distinguish between individuals and social groups [and] to enact difference across a range of times and spaces" (123). Nick Couldry and Ulises A. Mejias (2019) do not shy away from this; rather, they urge a resiuating of big data in the context of continuing colonialism as what they call "data colonialism." This term is an extremely useful reframing for creating a continuous thread connecting historical approaches to data (and human) management with current ones, which may at first glance appear quite different but share not only media histories but sometimes (un)ethical approaches:

>data colonialism is changing society by transforming human life into a new abstracted social form that is also ripe for commodification: data. The means for this transformation are---to reiterate--not labor relations, but, more broadly, commodified social relations, or, more succinctly, data relations. [...] These new types of social relations implicate human beings in processes of data extraction, but in ways that do not _prima facie_ seem extractive. That is the key point: the audacious yet largely disguised corporate attempt to incorporate all of life, whether or not conceived by those doing it as “production,” into an expanded process for the generation of surplus value. The extraction of data from bodies, things, and systems create new possibilities for managing everything. This is the new and distinctive role of platforms and other environments of routine data extraction. (343)

Simone Browne (2015) points to colonial-era hobbiest botanical classification and other scientific and pseudoscientific taxonomies occuring alongside human classification, exploitation, and economic trade: "human categorization and division is part of a larger imperial project of colonial expansion that aimed to fix, frame, and naturalize discursively constructed difference" (96). The main operational mode of computation as it is understood today is classification/categorization, which when taken as the main metaphor for contemporary thought continue to "naturalize discursively constructed difference." Computation and data, it could be argued, are part of the imperialist project. It may be possible to imagine other forms of computation not built on concepts of binary classification (down to the level of voltage and switches), but perhaps not within a culture built on and so deeply invested in these values. 

Browne calls for "a critical biometric consciousness" that connects contemporary technologies to their violent anti-Black histories---used for population management, punishment, and racial profiling---and contends with their application to these ends in the present. She defines biometrics as "a technology of measuring the living body. The application of this technology is in the verification, identification, and automation practices that enable the body to function as evidence” (109). Along with ex-slave narratives, plantation rules, the census, runaway advertisements, ship manifests, and other documents of the transatlantic slave trade, Browne details how branding was "a biometric technology, as it was a measure of slavery’s making, marking, and marketing of the black subject as commodity" (91). Further, "the branding of blackness remains visible, and also makes certain brands visible" (92). She says, branding is not only "a material practice of hot irons on skin, but as a racializing act, where the one-drop rule was a technology of branding blackness that maintained the enslaved body as black" (92). Connecting this to present-day practices, Browne refers to "digital epidermalization" as what happens to certain bodies when "algorithms are the computational means through which the body, or more specifically parts, pieces, and, increasingly, performances of the body are mathematically coded as data, making for unique templates for computers to then sort [...], or to verify the identity [...,] also used for automation [..., or] to detect a user’s presence and gestures" (109). The effect of digital epidermalization is potentially alienation from the self and profound precarity, she says, at borders or voting booths, welfare offices or prisons, "moments where identification, and increasingly biometric information, is required to speak the truth of and for muted bodies. These sites and moments are productive of, and often necessitate, ontological insecurity" (110). Digital epidermalization in these moments can override one's own truth about oneself.

In Sonya Rapoport's 1983 work, "The Computer Says I Feel," one of the installation participants describes, "I feel much better... good... great!" And then a stern, authoritative voice declares instead, "The computer says 'CAUTION'." The cover of the 'hand' book for the installation reads, with one piece of the phrase per finger, "In this mechanized age, computer overrides all opinions."

_juxtaposing/leveling different knowledge systems/value systems (palm reading, self-reporting, computer-as-authority, bringing emotion into the 'rational' computational sphere_
  
</div>

This idea that data speaks with more authority than certain types of people carries across platforms, races, genders, but seems to be informed mostly by whom is in power and what their values are about rationality and knowledge: who gets to know themselves, who gets to know about others, who has access to data. As Jacqueline Wernimont (2018) argues, these data are used as evidence often that supercedes the direct experience or testimony of the person in question: "[they] either preempt or bolster women’s narrations of embodied experiences. In each of these instances, there is a sense that a data collection device can testify to the state of a woman’s body in ways that reveal truth---a pregnancy, injury, or perhaps subterfuge. What’s more, the data themselves are subject to further semiotic transformation before they come to testify on behalf of or against these women" (156). Even with the knowledge that the data have been manipulated beforehand, data may speak with more authority than the disenfranchised subject, who may also have no control over “the kinds of labor that the body-being-counted does for others” (9).

From the 16th century, according to Wernimont (2018), and gaining popularity into the 18th century, the pedometer (111) began as a tool for measuring distance, not the effort of the wearer, (123), and so first gained popularity for its imperialist abilities to "mediate territorial power" over land (123). Later the 'waywiser' moves away from the domain of the elite white gentleman's conspicuous consumption and need "to measure the land and situate the wearer’s body therein," (123) to a measure of health or infirmity (but still wealth) (123). By the 19th century this same 'perambulator' became instead a measure for labor and morality of both genders among the white elite. Wernimont cites stories of a wife writing to the newspaper wishing to track her husband's evening excursions (130) and several accounts of pedometers at debutante balls in which "the pedometer stands in as a technology able to reveal to anxious men the moral status of the woman being surveilled" (133). By the early 20th century, "quantifiable female body norms like weight and discussions of pedometers to improve household efficiencies emerged together in the context of increasing pressures to optimize industrial practices" (140). Interestingly, Wernimont suggests quantifying technologies like the census are not exclusive to Western colonialist projects, but remain rooted in the impulse to control populations: 

>"processes and media for political arithmetic were a well-integrated part of fifteenth-century Incan statecraft, suggesting that these textile-based censuses were an even earlier innovation (perhaps in the eleventh or twelfth century). [...] Incan officials used quipu ["a system of cords and knots, frequently made of cotton and dyed in a variety of colors"] to record and preserve censuses of newly colonized communities, track the productivity of mines, communicate the composition of workforces, and track and calculate tributes owed by colonized communities. [...] Other communities used three-dimensional textiles and other forms of visual representation to accomplish many of the same goals. Despite the radically different materials, each of the census traditions is deeply tied to statecraft, colonial oversight, and systems of taxation and management, suggesting that the process of enumeration is foundational while the media are variable. (42--43)

These traces of violence are latent in the objects in our pockets. According to Ed Finn (2017), the precursor to the ubiquitous Siri was developed by DARPA to help field commanders and was originally named for the Latin for "soldier's servant" (57--58), though this militaristic history is nowhere in Apple's advertising of the voice assistant. "The original Siri also had a sharper edge to its dialog, occasionally deploying four-letter words and plenty of attitude, which was part of its appeal for Jobs (though Apple quickly dialed down the software’s affect in-house). The software didn’t just know things, it was also knowing" (62). Finn also notes that while Siri continues to train on users' dialects, it also is "encouraging them to enunciate in specific, machine-legible ways and creating a kind of collaborative human–machine distribution curve of language" (63).

Berdugo's follow-up work [_Unpatentable Multi-Touch Aerobics_](https://www.liatberdugo.com/work/unpatentable) (2015-2016), is a fitness routine using the gestures familiar from smart devices: "These gestures have an owner: every time you slide two fingers up and down a trackpad, you’re leasing your movements from Apple; and they, in turn, are owning a little part of you. Unpatentable Multitouch Aerobics asks, how are we to react in the face of the commodification and privatization of our own bodily gestures?" (Berdugo). From my understanding, it arrived in this format because of the constraints of U.S. copyright law which made it the only format not patentable by Apple. This piece appears to have spawned several subsequent works, such as _Anti-Trump Aerobics_ (2017), _Internet Aerobics_ (2018-2020), and other multimedia projects relating to the absurd physicalities of work and labor.

</div>

Wernimont's historical examples show, but contemporary examples continue to suggest that these products not only carry their histories with them but also contstruct identities that are specifically gendered and raced, often amplifying stereotypes: "Whether susceptible to a snack attack, or a literal attack, the assumed potential victimhood of bodies gendered female is a telling illustration of broader cultural anxieties being reproduced within these new technologies, anxieties that feed into the identities these technologies are helping to construct” (Wissinger 2017, 374). As the embodied gestures of Liat Berdugo's pieces suggest, humans are very much attached to these data points and data bodies. Couldry and Mejias (2019) use data colonialism to remind us the stakes are literal and material: "Even though the new social knowledge is produced through operations that bypass human beings, it is actual human beings, not 'doubles,' who are tethered to the discriminations that such knowledge generates. It is a real person who gets offered a favorable price in the supermarket, an opportunity for social housing, or a legal penalty, all based on algorithmic reasoning" (344). Finn points out the key paradox where the virtual and material overlap in network culture, the cloud. He says, "The cloud seems physically intangible even as it serves to cover or obscure these layers of abstraction and human labor behind the spectacle of computation" (132). Ironically the spectacle of as-a-service cloud offerings and share economies cover over very same supply chain logics whose origins are in the transatlantic slave trade: 

>"But for the workers servicing these warehouses, the architecture of step-counting, numerical targets, and other game mechanics embody the realities of that idealized, game-like narrative across real space and real lives. The cloud functions as an opaque membrane deflecting public attention, ethical inquiries, and legal liability, so we can all continue playing the online shopping game with no obligation, and few opportunities, to empathize or interact with a human being" (Finn 2017, 133)

Finn argues that corporations are able to market the interface as a mediating layer that absorbs and diffuses "common socioeconomic barriers like class, gender, and race through the magic of five-star ratings and computationally validated trust. [...]" (130). As he suggests, the interface does "not just the logistical but the ethical and cultural work for us" while asking of us in exchange an oversimplified version of identity (130). Couldry and Mejias call for a denaturalization of these practices:  "Resistance to data colonialism [...] rejects the idea that the continuous collection of data from human beings is natural, let alone rational; and so rejects the idea that the results of data processing are a naturally occurring form of social knowledge, rather than a commercially motivated form of extraction that advances particular economic and/or governance interests" (346).

## 2. passing & flagging: dark susveillance, adaptable forms

Resistance to data colonialism, or surveillance broadly, also has its historical antecedents in the resistance practices of enslaved people, argues Simone Browne. She finds oppositional energy for another way of being by looking to "black epistemologies of contending with antiblack surveillance, where the tools of social control in plantation surveillance or lantern laws in city spaces and beyond were appropriated, co-opted, repurposed, and challenged in order to facilitate survival and escape" (22). She details examples of enslaved and formerly enslaved people evading these systems by passing, disguise, alternate communication networks, literacy, and more (55); and she argues that this group of strategies, which she terms "dark sousveillance [...] also provides a way to frame how the contemporary surveillance of the racial body might be contended with" (24).

These strategies of resistence rely on a combination of obfuscation and adaptation, working with and against the grain of data colonialism, and must address a multi-pronged concerns. Lupton suggests that the contemporary worry of data-profilers acquiring 'too much' knowledge has overshadowed the equally dangerous problems of innacurate and missing information, or the socio-economic disadvantages of data invisibility (125). However, in one counter-example, Nabil Hassein (2017) argues against improving the bias of facial recognition technologies, as this technology is so frequently used for law enforcement, which has been shown to unfairly uphold white supremacist anti-Black oppression: "Why should we desire our faces to be legible for efficient automated processing by systems of their design?" ([Hassein, "Against Black Inclusion in Facial Recognition"](https://digitaltalkingdrum.com/2017/08/15/against-black-inclusion-in-facial-recognition/){:target="_blank"})

From the earliest examples I could find, analog forms like the paper diary proved adaptable to different uses---"nondigital mediations allowed for narrative and numerate tracking of women’s lives" (Wernimont 2018, 142)---(granted these still required a certain status and knowledge, like literacy and access to paper and time to write, which would not have been available to people of all races or classes). Early white women's life writing was more daily and embodied, says Wernimont, "Where men followed meandering minds or put themselves in the mind of Christ, medieval and early modern English women's 'being in and becoming with' was situated in the social spaces of the home and materiality of bodies" (109). However, with the shift to contemporary technologies, the gendering has remained but the opportunities for appropriation and adaptation have foreclosed dramatically:  

>One of the ways in which the gendering of activity tracking has changed with the shift to mechanical and then digital pedometers is in the relative inaccessibility of the media for women’s appropriation. The interface of the manuscript page or book is relatively free from constraint; even in the tabular books and almanacs of the period, we see writers using forms designed to capture numbers in order to record a wide array of information. In contrast, tracking watches, bracelets, and necklaces along with their apps close off the data collection in ways that block women and gender-nonconforming or nonbinary people from hacking the media to create nonmasculine experiences and/or stories. The informational interfaces of digital media change, and the different media ecosystems today are mutually constitutive of one another, both working to create certain possibilities for lived experience and foreclosing others. (Wernimont 2018, 141)

</div>

I'll offer two more examples of overshadowed forms that could offer insights into different ways of thinking with data. Lately overtaken with apps like Grindr and Tinder, since the early 1970s some queer and kink communities have used the simple printed hankerchief in different colors and patterns, placed in a pocket, to indicate sexual preference, availability, and compatability. I would consider this not only an extremely adaptive form but also a kind of self-identifying data practice. Economical, unlimited to the number of colors of fabric one can shove in a back pocket or tie to an arm, leg, etc., the options are virtually endless to signal interest and compatability---or at least, if not legible to the viewer, act as a conversation starter.[^Lex]

[^Lex]: It's worth noting a newly popular lesbian, non-binary, and queer dating app [Lex](https://thisislex.app/){:target="_blank"} takes its inspiration from the abbreviation-riddled text-only ads from the Village Voice era, so perhaps hybrid forms are catching on.

Not dissimilarly, emoji today may do poorly to convey literal meaning in the same way a non-pictographic sentence would, but conversants often develop a common lexicon amongst themselves that bear no resemblance or even run counter to the standard definitions established by Unicode and that may update on the fly as the needs of the user change over time or per conversation: "the utility of an emoji lies in the indeterminacy of its pictographic versus iconographic legibility as a signifier of affect, emotion, or sociality" (Stark and Crawford 2015, 5). And yet, this exuberance again gets reabsorbed as affective labor by the capitalist enterprise, as "just another means to lure consumers to a platform, to extract data from them more efficiently, and to express a normative, consumerist, and predominantly cheery world-view" (8). Apple will learn which weird emoji I plan to use next, and Facebook (with its choice of just a handful of animated emoji) will use my selection to categorize my response to a post as a 'feeling' and sift my timeline (and the timelines of others) all without my noticing.

The key is having a flexible format (what Barthes would call a writerly text). The original platform, tool, medium, or language must be open enough to interpretation to be able to be appropriated. Hankerchiefs? Sure. Smiley faces? Yes, with some latent race issues circulating around the weird yellow skin color, okay. Sometimes a peach is not just a peach but a cute butt. But an app reminding you that you haven't gone running as far as your friends, while showing you an ad for Cheetos? That's just mean, with not much room for reappropriation. 

>"Where data gathering and analysis is part of everyday practice, when lodged in the memories and bodies of women, it has been called caring for others. But the self-care processes that wearable devices can track, manage, and analyze have been coded as part of a masculine pursuit of self-knowledge and self-control. [...] But this body of knowledge looks suspiciously like early Enlightenment paradigms that privileged white, male, bourgeois life as the only life worth knowing. [...] we are not simply talking about large-scale data storage and analysis creating different ways of knowing but also different ways of being." (Wernimont 2018, 143)

Lupton (2020) instead calls for an 'ethics of care' that can reconceptualize "personal data by re-humanizing them" (123), in part to "think about digital data as forms of matter" (123)---even as "a new form of human remains" just like bones (125). What would it mean to consider our data traces to be 'ours' as much as we consider other human remains? In part, to take an ethical stance with data assemblages, she argues, means not assuming data can 'speak for' anyone and requires asking "whose interests are served or neglected when agential cuts are made in response to digital datasets?" (124).

###  artists' intervention: @datahealing & @cyberdoula

![datahealingmeme](https://cdn.glitch.com/eaa18b38-3765-4c0b-8304-2af139b6b542%2Fdecolonialtexting.png?v=1597999550287){:target="_blank"}

"Data healing" according to its inventor, Neema Githere, is "alchemizing our data::trauma into: new technologies" ([@datahealing](https://www.instagram.com/datahealing){:target="_blank"}). She argues that, "By prioritzing love over likes, data healing asks us to consider alternative metrics of engagement on social media." She created the term in response to "data trauma" a term created by Olivia McKayla Ross [@cyberdoula](https://www.instagram.com/cyberdoula/){:target="_blank"} "to describe the compound effects of navigating digital infrastructures created to exploit, categorize, and discard personhood" ([Ross](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/digital-doulas-fixing-data-trauma){:target="_blank"}). Each of their work on social media helps reposition social media itself as potentially available for renewed practices of care and ethics, repair from past harms. Ross says she is responding to "the violence of being counted, of being sorted–and of not being counted, of not being sorted," and she frames her work as "teaching people how to build their nests out of plastic" ([Ross](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/digital-doulas-fixing-data-trauma){:target="_blank"}). One place to start? Githere suggests reparations are one form of data healing ([Githere](https://www.are.na/neema-xx/data-healing){:target="_blank"}).

Creating and making existing forms one's own are essential because externally programmed devices and their data constrain outputs, says Wernimont (2018) meaning results can "only point in one direction: success or failure in a [particular] paradigm [...] in ways that entirely missed political, environmental, and ethical contexts [...] for activity in favor of ones more supportive of the normalized behavior of affluent American citizens" (158). For example, the current commercially available Fitbit-style "activity monitors can only understand physical activity within a paradigm where the wearer is safe, not responsible for the care of others, and using activity for exercise, not survival" (158). Wernimont theorizes, like Ross and Githere have begun to enact, the need for a broader range of stories and storytellers, types of data and data structures, systems and support systems. "What kinds of stories cannot be told [...] because individuals do not have access to such media, the time to engage it fully, and/or do not have the security to reveal the details of their everyday experience without increasing their risk of domestic or state violence?" says Wernimont. "Can we imagine other possibilities?" (159).

## 3. otherwise: technophenomenological body art

>Artists who appropriate dataveillance techniques and tools as a medium for creative production inform, enlighten, and help us to imagine otherwise by refusing the fantasy of exodus, a withdrawal from a given political, economic, or cultural system predicated on the notion that there is a neutral external vantage point from which one can begin the work of critical assessment. In a very general sense we might term such work immanent critique: art-activism operating within a given structure and inhabiting a particular perspectival frame. (Rita Raley 2013, 135)

Artistic approaches to data can "reveal the more-than-representational dimensions of data assemblages, particularly the affective and sensory aspects that may be difficult to articulate in conventional modes" (Lupton 2020, 66). Lupton cites two examples I found particularly engaging: 

>"Luke Munn's _Domestic data_ (2019) uses the contents of a home vacuum cleaner filter bag as data that can reveal patterns of activity of the home's inhabitants, including pets. Tyler Fox's (2018) work focuses on highlighting the ways in which nonhuman organisms can beemployed to visualize human data. His _Biolesce_ project involved bioluminescent algae that emitted flashes of intense blue light in response to human heartbeats tracked by digital sensors." (Lupton 2020, 65)

Both make unique use of natural materials as indexical markers of or in feedback with human patterns, as well as because they also speak at least loosely to the prior section's discussion of open, adaptable forms. The detritus of the vacuum bag recalls Lupton's data-as-remains and the question _To whom does the data one makes belong?_ (more on this later, time permitting).[^mine]

[^mine]: My data decomposes when the cloud service start-up I have uploaded my voice to (lyrebird.ai) in order to produce the voice synthesizer who will sound like me and speak as me for _innervoiceover_ is sold to a larger start-up. I have no way to download my synthesized voice, or my original voice, no way to reproduce the sound of me. The API through which I access myself one day just stops working and I follow the trail to an email in my spam folder warning me of its immanent shutdown---but no way to recover 'my' data. Where has my data gone to decompose? Who now owns the traces of me on that server somewhere, where? What they might one day make? What format they're in that will also go defunct or overheat or any other way technologies resist our attempts at immortality, preservation, ownership, leakage prevention?

"Horn has described how wearing these gloves altered her relationship with her surroundings, so that distant objects came within her reach: ‘the finger gloves are light. I can move them without any effort. Feel, touch, grasp anything, but keeping a certain distance from the objects. The lever-action of the lengthened fingers intensifies the various sense-data of the hand; [...] I feel me touching, I see me grasping, I control the distance between me and the objects.’" [--Tate gallery label, 2016](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/horn-finger-gloves-t07845)

"Strapped around the face, this mask transforms the wearer’s head into an instrument for drawing. Horn has described wearing it: ‘All pencils are about two inches long and produce the profile of my face in three dimensions...I move my body rhythmically from left to right in front of a white wall. The pencils make marks on the wall the image of which corresponds to the rhythm of my movements.’ The spike-like pencils make this one of Horn’s more threatening works. However, it is linked to the feather masks, as feather quills were also once used for writing."

_wearable non-digital technology, to extend the reach of the body also encumbers the body, also creates data, makes a mark or trace, prosthesis_ 

</div>

What Amelia Jones (1998) calls “body art” are intersubjective performative practices that decenter the individualist Cartesian subject of modernism (1). Importantly, in these works as she views them, the body is not a "representation to be performed with or against the grain of some core identity nor as pure immanence that can be transcended through thought or virtual technologies” (235). Instead, she argues that body art practices ground us interrelationally through their mediating technology: 

>[This kind of work] ultimately points to an expansion of the phenomenological relation to a technophenomenological relation that intertwines intersubjectivity with interobjectivity: we are enworlded via the envelopment of our bodies in space, the touch of our hands on a keyboard, the stroke of our gaze on the video screen. Seemingly paradoxically, given the conventional association of technology with disembodiment and disengagement from the world, recent body-oriented practices have increasingly mobilized and highlighted this reversibility, using the artists' own body/self as both subject and object, as multiplicitous, particular, and unfixable, and engaging with audiences in increasingly interactive ways. (239)

Further, she points out that a technophenomenological viewpoint allows, or requires, us to acknowledge its material stakes, "to experience ourselves as not only in the world, but as also belonging to it and thus owing it something: as fully contingent bodies/selves who are responsible for the effects our behaviors and perceptions have on others and aware of our reactions to other subjects and objects in the world. This technophenomenological understanding of the body/self poses it as deeply socialized and politicized” (239–240). This view connects with Sarah Kember and Johanna Zylinska's focus on mediation as the primary way of "being-in and emerging-with the world" (23) and with media objects as but temporary stabilizations of that flow (21), which allows for a more ethical relationship with technology and with each other. They argue: 

>From this critical cybernetic perspective, the human is seen as having always been technological, or having always been mediated. To put it differently, technology and media are precisely what makes us human. [...] this position allows for a better understanding of what we have posited in this book as the relationality of the world—--of which we are part. [...] All this is not to say that in the universe of complex relations between human and nonhuman beings “anything goes” and that all connections are equally good. But seeing ourselves as always already connected, as being part of the system—--rather than as masters of the universe to which all beings are inferior—--is an important step in developing a more critical and a more responsible relationship to the world, to what we call 'man,' 'nature,' and 'technology'. It is also a promise of the emergence of some more productive media relations and media environments. (194)

They call this always-already mediated state "originary technicity" and connect it to our dependence on each other as an ethical imperative: "Originary technicity can thus be understood as a condition of openness to what is not part of the human, of having to depend on alterity [...] to fully constitute and actualize one’s being. But this imperative to get outside of oneself and to be technical, that is, to bring things forth, to create, is perhaps also an ethical injunction to create well" (17--18). For Jones, it is paradoxically through deep engagement with "knowing thyself" that a technophenomenological data body artist might access this alterity. She says, "it is the very narcissism of the performance of the self that inexorably engages the self in the other: our self-conception, our self-performance can only take place through our phenomenological assumption of subjectivity (or moments of subjective engagement) via others in the world" (238). Of course, she also points out that this self for more recent artists is much more unmoored, "technologized, specifically unnatural, and fundamentally unfixable in identity or subjective/objective meaning in the world: [...] This 'posthuman' body/self is thoroughly particularized, its gender, sexuality, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, class, and other identifications insistently enunciated within the intersubjective structures established by the body-oriented practice" (199).

### artist's intervention: Sarah Ciston

[_Uncertainty Index_](https://sarahciston.com/ui/) is an example of a form I developed for my MFA thesis which I refer to as quantified confessional poetry, among other things, which links personal 'metadata' to each  based on the date it was originally written---trails of data attached to each fragment or phrase. The poem is an endless loop, ending where it starts, and is resortable by the categories and qualities listed in its database. In this way, the piece works over the the text as a body as a database as a storage site of trauma and text.

![datacollection](https://cdn.glitch.com/eaa18b38-3765-4c0b-8304-2af139b6b542%2Fpersonaldata2017.jpg?v=1597986001587){: width="390px" }

In my 2017 performance of _Uncertainty Index_, I requested from the audience reciprocal data in the form of their mood and/or weight on a slip of paper, inserted into this jar passed around the room. I haven't opened the jar, ahtough some handwritten and typed phrases are visible. The slips of paper are scraps from drafts of the manuscript. This reminds me of what I learned later from [Feminist.AI](http://feminist.ai){:target="_blank"} to practice requesting what they call 'data donations', i.e. informed consent, rather than a fine-print terms of service covering their data extraction practice. These subtle shifts in approach point toward new possibilities for being with data. As Ross describes, words like 'submission' already describe "the power differentials when giving away information" ([Ross](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/digital-doulas-fixing-data-trauma){:target="_blank"}).
{: .fs-3 }

The technical code work I did in preparation for these exams was another step for this project, because in order to build this site I learned to connect programmatically to the live data outputs my personal trackers are producing using their APIs (previous projects had used downloaded static data in CSVs rather than live updating). This will allow me to build future projects that act on the data they pull on the fly, whether manipulating it aesthetically or analytically. My goal is to do another iteration of this or similar work as a wearable body suit that transmits to either a site and/or a second display body suit, as referenced in my creative-critical GIF essay ["The Haptics of Not Touching"](https://medium.com/@sarahciston/the-haptics-of-not-touching-b7f9b889e2df){:target="_blank"} which addresses some of the anxieties around these themes (in particular body-as-performance/database/API, subscription capitalism, and (lately) touch without touch.

_adapting forms, diary, database, quantification of qualitative data_
  
</div>

>"Living with data is a mode of being, making and becoming. These data are not inscribed on bodies: they work with and through bodies" (Lupton 2020, 122). 

This research has shown the necessity and the possibility to live with data "as a mode of being, making, and becoming" in ways that are embodied not imposed upon but designed by intended/actual users, adaptable to needs other than what was originally imagined, accessible across social strata, care-full and aware of interconnection with other technologies, other humans, and other species. As Jones says regarding her hope for the impact of body art, "this claim is rather utopian; the effects of these works will of course depend on how they are contextualized and who experiences and engages with them" (203). Given the incredible ingenuity shown in the face of data colonialism and violence across centuries---despite the increasingly proprietary and pernicious systems that impose closed platforms and tools whose logics further mediate and oppress---artists and other producers of data (whom they call their users) still find ways to 'misuse', 'borrow', and 'steal back' their data.[^mine2] 

[^mine2]: So is my data mine? This may be the whole problem and point in a nutshell. The big-data multi-corp would say no: "That users might need to take back data about their embodied experience testifies to the degree to which the informational flow has changed, thus positioning the data creator as reader versus author/artist" (Wernimont 2018, 141). The post-humanist would say no (oversimplifying) because there is no 'my' but a meshwork of influence, and the critical race theorist would point out that some folks never got a humanist 'my' or a 'human' to begin with. The feminist new materialist (among others invested in mutal aid) "would thus set up a kind of safety net for those humans who are now [...] routinely made to suffer because they do not conform to a particular (Euro-American, bourgeois, theocentric, or other) model of personhood. The ethical aim becomes to distribute value more generously, to bodies as such" (Jane Bennett 2010, 13). The short answer: This data is our data. Now what shall we do with it; how shall we help?
