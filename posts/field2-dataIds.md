#### exam question

In this section you ask (as a parenthetical “bonus” question) why data extracted and produced in the course of everyday engagements with “algorithmic systems” should even be called “’mine,’ given their complicated histories, trajectories, and impacts?” I’m particularly interested here in their “histories,” which encompass in your argument both extreme brutality (e.g. quantitative techniques developed within the transatlantic slave trade) and more “subversive” possibilities (you give the example here of paper diaries). I would like to hear much more from you about historical antecedents to contemporary hybrid (creative/critical/technical) practices and how they both blur into and are distinct from those practices. I would especially like to hear, time permitting, about how “overshadowed” forms (like diaries, among others) might have informed your own creative practice, or that of your artistic contemporaries.

## 0. introduction



qualities these works share: open, adaptable in format; user designed; embodied not imposed upon a body; reappropriate; hyperboly or activism;
old to new: increasingly producing closed systems that impose the tools or platforms that mediate, although users/artists still misuse, borrow, steal; new tech more subtly makes use of what's already on the body, violence more insidious (for some, at least)

>"With the virtual body came its fascist sibling, the data body—a much more highly developed virtual form, and one that exists in complete service to the corporate and police state. The data body is the total collection of files connected to an individual" (Critical Art Ensemble 1998, 145). 

What even is data? Miriam Posner and Lauren Klein (2017) build on definitions by Christine Borgman and Daniel Rosenberg to argue that, in addition to being "contingent and time-based" as well as "_specifically_ rhetorical," they add "categorization and computability" (1). Importantly, Posner and Klein call data as much an orientation to source material as a kind of knowlege (2). 


## 1. history was awful and the present isn't looking pretty

Étienne-Jules Marey is a prominent figure in the story of the long histories of violence emerging from the colonialist impulses toward classification, datification, taxonomy, encyclopedic knowledge, and ownership. In 1859, he invented the sphygmograph, a direct indexical measure of the rhythms of bloodflow---from wrist to stylus to carbon (Osman 2019, 13). His sphygmograph sounds like something to be cleaned up later and appears like a clackering stigmata against the vulnerable pulse point inside the wrist. Meanwhile his other chronolocomotive tools built to capture motion otherwise imperceptible to the eye resemble guns and and 19th-century FitBit torture device.

As precursors to the contemporary data devices we enjoy and are annoyed by today, these objects are oft cited when sketching the history of wearable technology and personal data. But the story goes back much further and persists in todays materials, practices, and concerns, however invisibly embedded and embodied. 

The ability and interest in classification and differentiation of people was (and is) directly tied to the project of oppression. As Alexander Weheliye (2014) frames it, race is created for racism---and declared 'natural' to justify its violence: “the biopolitical function of race is racism” (42). He details how this project categorizes state subjects into degrees of human, using categories of non-human to do so: "Despite having no real basis in biochemistry, the hieroglyphics of the flesh requires grounding in the biological sphere so as to facilitate—even as it conceals and because it masks—the political, economic, social, and cultural disciplining (semiosis of procedure) of the Homo sapiens species into assemblages of the human, not-quite-human, and nonhuman; this is what I am referring to as racialization" (33).

As new practices of digital data collection increase at-scale, the extractive practices of colonialism are also amplified. Nick Couldry and Ulises A. Mejias (2019) urge a resiuating of big data in the context of continuing colonialism as what they call "data colonialism," and this term is useful for creating a continuous thread connecting historical approaches to data (and human) management with current ones, which may at first glance appear quite different but share not only media histories but sometimes (un)ethical approaches:

>data colonialism is changing society by transforming human life into a new abstracted social form that is also ripe for commodification: data. The means for this transformation are---to reiterate--not labor relations, but, more broadly, commodified social relations, or, more succinctly, data relations. [...] These new types of social relations implicate human beings in processes of data extraction, but in ways that do not _prima facie_ seem extractive. That is the key point: the audacious yet largely disguised corporate attempt to incorporate all of life, whether or not conceived by those doing it as “production,” into an expanded process for the generation of surplus value. The extraction of data from bodies, things, and systems create new possibilities for managing everything. This is the new and distinctive role of platforms and other environments of routine data extraction. (343)

## Stuff I haven't used yet

#### Lupton

>"data selves are more-than-human because they are always more-than-individual and more-than-human" (Lupton 2020, 121). "Living with data is a mode of being, making and becoming. These data are not inscribed on bodies: they work with and through bodies" (122). 

>"As part of automated decision-making regimes, data are exploited to distinguish between individuals and social groups [and] to enact difference across a range of times and spaces" (Lupton 2020, 123).

Lupton suggests that the worry of dataveillance acquiring 'too much' knowledge obfuscates the problems of innacurate and missing information, or the socio-economic disadvantages of data invisibility (125). However, in one counter-example, Nabil Hassein (2017) argues against improving the bias of facial recognition technologies, as this technology is so frequently used for law enforcement, which has been shown to unfairly uphold white supremacist anti-Black oppression: "Why should we desire our faces to be legible for efficient automated processing by systems of their design?" ([Hassein, "Against Black Inclusion in Facial Recognition"](https://digitaltalkingdrum.com/2017/08/15/against-black-inclusion-in-facial-recognition/))

Lupton (2020) calls for an 'ethics of care' that can reconceptualize "personal data by re-humanizing them" (123), in part to "think about digital data as forms of matter" (123)---even as "a new form of human remains" (125). To take an ethical stance with data assemblages, she argues, means not assuming data can 'speak for' anyone and requires asking "whose interests are served or neglected when agential cuts are made in response to digital datasets?" (124). _see also my data decomp problem_

"data sense" (76)

"Luke Munn's _Domestic data_ (2019) uses the contents of a home vacuum cleaner filter bag as data that can reveal patterns of activity of the home's inhabitants, including pets. "Tyler Fox's (2018) work focuses on highlighting the ways in which nonhuman organisms can beemployed to visualize human data. His _Biolesce_ project involved bioluminescent algae that emitted flashes of intense blue light in response to human heartbeats tracked by digital sensors." (Lupton 2020, 65)

Lupton cites an example of an artistic intervention that connects some of the historical brutalities mentioned here to the contemporary dataveillance practices:
>The _Algorithmic History Museum_ was a pop-up exhibition [...] to present fictionalized algorithmic 'solutions' to historical 'problems' [.... For example,] for slaves to wear bracelets that track their exercise" in order to 'solve' the scenario of enslaved people captured by Dutch traders dying "en route to the Netherlands due to the appaulling living conditions on the vessels in which they were imprisoned. [...] The contemporary analogy is that of third parties exploiting for profit the data generated by people wearing digital devices [...] and questions the privacy of these data and coercion to wear them (e.g. by employers or health insurance companies). (72) 

She argues "Creative design- and arts-based approaches to personal data can begin to reveal the more-than-representational dimensions of data assemblages, particularly the affective and sensory aspects that may be difficult to articulate in conventional modes" (Lupton 2020, 66).

"'data sweat', 'data trash', 'data bodies', 'data doubles'" (46)

### Historical to Contemporary, Brutal to Subversive, Surveillance & Susveillance

#### Mejias & Couldry / Contemp


unfortunately humans are still attached to these data bodies, the stakes are material
>“Even though the new social knowledge is produced through operations that bypass human beings, it is actual human beings, not “doubles,” who are tethered to the discriminations that such knowledge generates. It is a real person who gets offered a favorable price in the supermarket, an opportunity for social housing, or a legal penalty, all based on algorithmic reasoning” (Couldry and Mejias 2019, 344)

this is not natural or rational, but capitalist and motivated, for powerful interests
>“[...Resistance to data colonialism [...] rejects the idea that the continuous collection of data from human beings is natural, let alone rational; and so rejects the idea that the results of data processing are a naturally occurring form of social knowledge, rather than a commercially motivated form of extraction that advances particular economic and/or governance interests” (Couldry and Mejias 2019, 346)



#### Weheliye

critique of posthumanism
>“many invocations of posthumanism, whether in antihumanist post-structuralist theorizing or in current considerations of technology and animality, reinscribe the humanist subject (Man) as the personification of the human by insisting that this is the category to be overcome, rarely considering cultural and political formations outside the world of Man that might offer alternative versions of humanity. 18 Moreover, posthumanism and animal studies isomorphically yoke humanity to the limited possessive individualism of Man, because these discourses also presume that we have now entered a stage in human development where all subjects have been granted equal access to western humanity and that this is, indeed, what we all want to overcome” (Weheliye 2014, 15).


#### Browne

>“biometrics is a technology of measuring the living body. The application of this technology is in the verification, identification, and automation practices that enable the body to function as evidence” (S Browne 2015, 109).

>“Importantly, a critical biometric consciousness must acknowledge the connections between contemporary biometric information technologies and their historical antecedents. Meaning here that this critical biometric consciousness must contend with the ways that branding, particularly within racial slavery, was instituted as a means of population management that rendered whiteness prototypical through its making, marking, and marketing of blackness as visible and as commodity. As well, it must contend with the ways in which branding was a form of punishment and racial profiling” (S Browne 2015, 118).

Along with ex-slave narratives, plantation rules, the census, runaway advertisements, ship manifests, and other documents of the transatlantic slave trade, Browne details how branding was "a biometric technology, as it was a measure of slavery’s making, marking, and marketing of the black subject as commodity" (91). Further, "the branding of blackness remains visible, and also makes certain brands visible" (92). She says, branding is not only "a material practice of hot irons on skin, but as a racializing act, where the one-drop rule was a technology of branding blackness that maintained the enslaved body as black" (92).



>“the tracking of blackness as property informs the contemporary surveillance of the racial body [...] questioning how the intimate relation between branding and the black body---our biometric past---can allow us to think critically about our biometric present” (S Browne 2015, 91)

def souveillance, as critique as praxis, historical and contemporary 
>“Dark sousveillance, then, plots imaginaries that are oppositional and that are hopeful for another way of being. Dark sousveillance is a site of critique, as it speaks to black epistemologies of contending with antiblack surveillance, where the tools of social control in plantation surveillance or lantern laws in city spaces and beyond were appropriated, co-opted, repurposed, and challenged in order to facilitate survival and escape. [...] Dark sousveillance is also a reading praxis for examining surveillance that allows for a questioning of how certain surveillance technologies installed during slavery to monitor and track blackness as property (for example, branding, the one-drop rule, quantitative plantation records that listed enslaved people alongside livestock and crops, slave passes, slave patrols, and runaway notices) anticipate the contemporary surveillance of racialized subjects, and it also provides a way to frame how the contemporary surveillance of the racial body might be contended with” (S Browne 2015, 22–24)

"The historical formation of surveillance is not outside of the historical formation of slavery." "narratives of ex-slaves, runaway slave advertisements, the census, and a set of plantation rules" (Browne 2015, 50)

>"Through their detailing of physical descriptions, the surveillance technology of the runaway slave advertisement was put to use to make the already hypervisible racial subject legible [...] Sall’s ability to evade surveillance through makeup, wicked tricks, and hiding in plain sight exposes the one-drop rule as a social construction that, for some, could be subverted by performing whiteness. Seth’s, or sometimes Sall’s, hiding in plain sightby identifying as white and using an alias—was a freedom practice to evade surveillance, and in so being a form of dark sousveillance." (Browne 2015, 54)
>"With Craft, her passing in terms of race, passing in terms of gender, passing in terms of class, and passing in terms of disability all played a role in her and William’s passing into freedom" (55).

>"In the United States, racial nomenclature as a form of population management was made official with the taking of the first federal census in 1790, [...] by way of formalized categories that fix individuals within a certain time and a particular space, making the census a technology that renders a population legible in racializing as well as gendering ways." (Browne 55--56) (_combined 2 ideas could resplit_) "it was left to the census taker to judge whether the census informant’s claim to the category of whiteness was valid, rather than accepting at face value the informant’s self-identification as white." (56)

>"commodity racism, that being to consume while at the same time alienating blackness. 55 Collecting and consuming blackness, and black people, whether kitsch or corporeal, forms part of the larger history continuing to the present of the ritualized practices and trauma of white supremacy, as the archive of lynching makes plain. After such extrajudicial killings and the ceremony that accompanied death, memorabilia would be taken, and oftentimes sold, as souvenirs" _blackness for sale, net.art not addressing race. browser names_

>

Browne points to the hobbiest botanical classification and other scientific and pseudoscientific taxonomies occuring alongside this human classification, exploitation, and economic trade: "human categorization and division is part of a larger imperial project of colonial expansion that aimed to fix, frame, and naturalize discursively constructed difference" (Browne 2015, 96). The main operational mode of computation as it is understood today is classification/categorization, which when taken as the main metaphor for contemporary thought continue to "naturalize discursively constructed difference." Computation and data, it could be argued, are part of the imperialist project. It may be possible to imagine other forms of computation not built on concepts of binary classification (down to the level of voltage and switches), but perhaps not within a culture built on and so deeply invested in these values. 

Browne refers to "digital epidermalization" as what happens to certain bodies when "algorithms are the computational means through which the body, or more specifically parts, pieces, and, increasingly, performances of the body are mathematically coded as data, making for unique templates for computers to then sort [...], or to verify the identity [...,] also used for automation [..., or] to detect a user’s presence and gestures" (109). The effect of digital epidermalization is potentially alienation from the self and profound precarity, she says, at borders or voting booths, welfare offices or prisons, "moments where identification, and increasingly biometric information, is required to speak the truth of and for muted bodies. These sites and moments are productive of, and often necessitate, ontological insecurity" (110). Digital epidermalization in these moments can override one's own truth about oneself.

~~>"Digital epidermalization is the exercise of power cast by the disembodied gaze of certain surveillance technologies (for example, identity card readers and e-passport verification machines) that can be employed to do the work of alienating the subject by producing a truth about the racial body and one’s identity (or identities) despite the subject’s claims” (2015, 110).~~

_methodological tools: process, abstraction, implementation, imagination_

Siri's history is militaristic
>“Siri and its antecedents had been in development for nearly a decade through the largest artificial intelligence project ever funded by the U.S. government, drawing over $150 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). [...] Siri’s precursor was designed to help field commanders who have to manage complex data and bureaucracy while remaining focused on strategic challenges. CALO was inspired by the Latin calonis, or soldier’s servant, giving a very different cast to its imagined cultural role: more executive officer than personal assistant” (Finn 2017, 57–58).
“The original Siri also had a sharper edge to its dialog, occasionally deploying four-letter words and plenty of attitude, which was part of its appeal for Jobs (though Apple quickly dialed down the software’s affect in-house). The software didn’t just know things, it was also knowing” (Finn 2017, 62)
“These fragments of interaction contribute to Siri’s adaptive learning curve, as if thousands or millions of dialect speakers are all passively educating the same virtual toddler in correct pronunciation, while the Siri interface at the same time shapes the inflections of those users, encouraging them to enunciate in specific, machine-legible ways and creating a kind of collaborative human–machine distribution curve of language” (Finn 2017, 63) field1

intimacies required for expanded self, creepvenience
>“We desire algorithms that truly know us and tell our stories. Anticipation requires intimacy.” (Finn 2017, 75)
>“we are hard at work constructing intimacy with algorithms, from our willingness to play along with Siri to the things we type into search bars when we think nobody is looking. We interact with search interfaces in intensely private ways—a strange, occasionally grotesque confessionalism at the altar of computation” (Finn 2017, 75)
>“This is [marketed as] a form of algorithmic proprioception, an expansion of the self, enabled by physical and cognitive sensors and feedback loops” (Finn 2017, 77).
>“Turing’s provocation asks us to consider intelligence and identity as different forms of the same boundary question, one that explores the physical and intellectual edges of selfhood” (Finn 2017, 80)

interface as barrier and doing the work of empathy
>“The sharing economy ultimately depends on an atomized form of intimacy, a series of fleeting, close encounters with strangers that are managed and underwritten (in emotional, financial, and liability terms) by algorithmic culture machines. [...] The real sell is the interface itself: the experience of computationally mediated culture and its underlying algorithmic simplification and abstraction” (Finn 2017, 129).
“The interface layer acts as a baffle or shock absorber, diffusing common socioeconomic barriers like class, gender, and race through the magic of five-star ratings and computationally validated trust. This form of arbitrage is a sophisticated triangulation of intimacies, asking participants to trade in or renegotiate certain facets of identity in favor of algorithmically crafted substitutes. [...] we outsource the determination of bias, of commercial viability, indeed of context itself, to the algorithm, asking the interface layer to do not just the logistical but the ethical and cultural work for us.” (Finn 2017, 130)

ethical issues and physicality for the workers that is obscured through the cloud, using wearable tech
>“The cloud seems physically intangible even as it serves to cover or obscure these layers of abstraction and human labor behind the spectacle of computation,” (Finn 2017, 132)... key paradox where virtual material overlap “But for the workers servicing these warehouses, the architecture of step-counting, numerical targets, and other game mechanics embody the realities of that idealized, game-like narrative across real space and real lives. The cloud functions as an opaque membrane deflecting public attention, ethical inquiries, and legal liability, so we can all continue playing the online shopping game with no obligation, and few opportunities, to empathize or interact with a human being” (Finn 2017, 133)

pretend AI is human labor, behind the computational layer of interface
>“marks the reversal of the computational instrument: now human brains are the black box, strung together into an ad-hoc network of wetware servers for odd jobs” (Finn 2017, 138)

could compare all these to the shipping manifests of the trade of enslaved peoples

#### Wernimont

>"contemporary self-tracking pratices are firmly rooted in racializing, colonizing, and gendering technologies of knowledge as well as control." (Wernimont 2018, 122)

colonial influenced logics, interface
>"Like the schema of early censuses and mortality counts, the established schema of mechanical step tracking quickly elided the ways in which colonial logics were both integrated and normalized by tracking devices and their outputs. While devices vary in detail, they almost all share a physical boundary like the watch face or digital output, and depend on the aesthetic rationality performed by spare numerical interfaces. The shared history with clockworks" (Wernimont 2018, 122)

From the 16th century, according to Wernimont (2018), and gaining popularity into the 18th century, the pedometer (or 'perambulator' or 'waywiser')(111) began as a tool for measuring distance, not the effort of the wearer, (123), and so first gained popularity for its imperialist abilities to "mediate territorial power" over land (123). Later the tool moves away from the domain of the elite white gentleman's conspicuous consumption and need "to measure the land and situate the wearer’s body therein," (123) to a measure of health or infirmity (but still wealth) (123). By the 19th century the pedometer became a measure for labor and morality of both genders among the white elite. Wernimont cites stories of a wife writing to the newspaper wishing to track her husband's evening excursions (130) and several accounts of pedometers at debutante balls and in which "the pedometer stands in as a technology able to reveal to anxious men the moral status of the woman being surveilled" (133). By the early 20th century, "quantifiable female body norms like weight and discussions of pedometers to improve household efficiencies emerged together in the context of increasing pressures to optimize industrial practices" (140). 

>"quantifications of life activities in recreational, social, and health contexts are part of the construction of whiteness, and especially certain kinds of valued white masculinity and white femininity, prior to the mid-twentieth century. The quantification of black life did occur, but it tended to happen within the different contexts of enslavement and labor quotas." (144--145)

>"For lifestyle users, giving up their data is a voluntary (if frequently hidden) act. Parolees and those under other forms of legal surveillance have little choice about the data collection, and have even more limited access to the data than do commercial device wearers. This is a racialized and racializing difference;" (150)

Know thyself, foucault
>"know thyself has long been cover for self-regulation and wealth generation in the service of the nation-state and other institutional entities" (151) "Knowing thyself looks an awful lot like corporate efforts to know and shape the consumer body" (155).

>"In Greek and Roman texts, the injunction of having to know yourself was always associated with the other principle of having to take care of yourself" (20) ... "There has been an inversion between the hierarchy of the two principles of antiquity, "Take care of yourself" and "Know thyself." In Greco-Roman culture knowledge of oneself appeared as the consequence of taking care of yourself. In the modern world, knowledge of oneself constitutes the fundamental principle." (Foucault , 22)

data speaks with more authority than certain types of people, who gets to know themselves, who gets to know about others, access to data, relates to Browne's biometric data as evidence
>"quantum media are being used to either preempt or bolster women’s narrations of embodied experiences. In each of these instances, there is a sense that a data collection device can testify to the state of a woman’s body in ways that reveal truth—a pregnancy, injury, or perhaps subterfuge. What’s more, the data themselves are subject to further semiotic transformation before they come to testify on behalf of or against these women;" (156)

the programmed constraints mean the devices and their data outputs can "only point in one direction: success or failure in a health paradigm [...] in ways that entirely missed political, environmental, and ethical contexts [...] for activity in favor of ones more supportive of the normalized behavior of affluent American citizens" (158):

>"**activity monitors can only understand physical activity within a paradigm where the wearer is safe, not responsible for the care of others, and using activity for exercise, not survival" (158).**

>"the “we” of device wearers are not really building the “we” imagined" (158)

>"Such mediations thus violently rewrite [...] experiences" (159)

>"What kinds of stories cannot be told with either a commercial report or even [an] artistic mapping because individuals do not have access to such media, the time to engage it fully, and/or do not have the security to reveal the details of their everyday experience without increasing their risk of domestic or state violence? Do we really want a suite of quantifying tools built largely by a long progression of white Christian men to be the dominant media for understanding and living human life? Can we imagine other possibilities?" (159)


open/closed forms, appropriating for own use
>"One of the ways in which the gendering of activity tracking has changed with the shift to mechanical and then digital pedometers is in the relative inaccessibility of the media for women’s appropriation. The interface of the manuscript page or book is relatively free from constraint; even in the tabular books and almanacs of the period, we see writers using forms designed to capture numbers in order to record a wide array of information. In contrast, tracking watches, bracelets, and necklaces along with their apps close off the data collection in ways that block women and gender-nonconforming or nonbinary people from hacking the media to create nonmasculine experiences and/or stories. The informational interfaces of digital media change, and the different media ecosystems today are mutually constitutive of one another, both working to create certain possibilities for lived experience and foreclosing others." (Wernimont 2018, 141)

>"That users might need to take back data about their embodied experience testifies to the degree to which the informational flow has changed, thus positioning the data creator as reader versus author/artist" (141)

>"We are not currently ourselves, they claim, but wearable tracking devices, apps, and other so-called lifestyle integrations can help us map a way to find ourselves—out there, in the data. Such claims assert that processes of abstraction and surveillance enable self-understanding and fulfillment. The good life, they maintain, can be had with the help of a wrist bracelet or clip used to carefully monitor behaviors and behavioral change. Such logic may not be especially unusual. Meditation is a practice based on self-observation as well. But the fact that meaning making is outsourced to corporations suggests a commercialized panopticon embedded in and around bodies and everyday digital practices." (Wernimont 2018, 96)

prestige, normalizing
> "As such devices circulate in a prestige economy, they perform the normalizing function discussed elsewhere for mortality counts and population statistics. Steptracking devices draw on both the prestige of fine instruments and enumeration to shore up the value of human activity tracking, and they normalize such devices as important and even necessary to human life." (130)

scale, honesty/morality, imperialist
>"quantum media can work in service of large-scale imperial or national claims of rights and authority, but they can also attest to the honesty, reputation, and labor of individuals. This is a critical feature of quantum media: their flexibility to operate across a range of scales." (129)

>"processes and media for political arithmetic were a well-integrated part of fifteenth-century Incan statecraft, , suggesting that these textile-based censuses were an even earlier innovation (perhaps in the eleventh or twelfth century). [...] Incan officials used quipu ["a system of cords and knots, frequently made of cotton and dyed in a variety of colors"] to record and preserve censuses of newly colonized communities, track the productivity of mines, communicate the composition of workforces, and track and calculate tributes owed by colonized communities." (42)
>"Other communities used three-dimensional textiles and other forms of visual representation to accomplish many of the same goals. Despite the radically different materials, each of the census traditions is deeply tied to statecraft, colonial oversight, and systems of taxation and management, suggesting that the process of enumeration is foundational while the media are variable." (43)

>“the kinds of labor that the body-being-counted does for others” (Wernimont 2018, 9)
normalizing, who counts, moral status
>“matrices of bodies and media” (Wernimont 2018, 4)

**non mediated/nonwhateverable forms, womens forms and dark susveillance**

Early women's life writing was more daily and embodied (109) "Where men followed meandering minds or put themselves in the mind of Christ, medieval and early modern English women's 'being in and becoming with' was situated in the social spaces of the home and materiality of bodies" (109). 

>"Where early modern life writing by women was able to take account of the domestic and embodied labors of women, the automation and algorithmic black boxing of twenty-first-century devices limits what is counted, and thereby limits the kinds of lives that can emerge as mediated by these technologies." (142)
"nondigital mediations allowed for narrative and numerate tracking of women’s lives" (142).

>"Where data gathering and analysis is part of everyday practice, when lodged in the memories and bodies of women, it has been called caring for others. But the self-care processes that wearable devices can track, manage, and analyze have been coded as part of a masculine pursuit of self-knowledge and self-control. [...] But this body of knowledge looks s ciously like early Enlightenment paradigms that privileged white, male, bourgeois life as the only life worth knowing. [...] we are not simply talking about large-scale data storage and analysis creating different ways of knowing but also different ways of being." (143)

Wernimont uses the metaphor of the matrices as “the media in which something is generated or developed. As a generative form, the matrix is a powerful way of understanding and critiquing binary logics and simple, progressive narratives” (11). Citing Vivian M. May, she says it also grounds intersectional practice and thought, “intersectional work focuses on 'enmeshed multiplicities,' including but not limited to those of race and gender. It also entails a commitment to ‘resistant forms of knowing’ [...]. The matrix logic of intersectional feminism ‘considers how inequalities intermingle,’ and stresses linkages between ‘the structural and experiential, and the material and the discursive’” (Wernimont 2018,  11).

>“three prevalent assumptions about women in the tech/ fashion field. First, women are potential victims. Second, women want to achieve difficult-to-attain physical ideals of health and optimum fitness. Third, women need to be constantly available and connected virtually, while also paying close attention to achieving high-level face-to-face interaction with those they are with, thus staying fully connected and totally present, at the same time” (Wissinger 2017, 373) 

victimhood, products contstruct identities specifically gendered, reproduce cultural anxieties
>“Whether susceptible to a snack attack, or a literal attack, the assumed potential victimhood of bodies gendered female is a telling illustration of broader cultural anxieties being reproduced within these new technologies, anxieties that feed into the identities these technologies are helping to construct” (Wissinger 2017, 374)


>"The need to return to face-to-face contact resonates with assumptions about femininity regarding emotional availability. Both women and men are suffering from technologically induced reductions in eye contact; attentiveness and availability to others’ needs, however, are behaviors traditionally coded feminine [...] with attention to herself significantly missing from that list” (Wissinger 2017, 380)

artists use dataveillance for why
>"Artists who appropriate dataveillance techniques and tools as a medium for creative production inform, enlighten, and help us to imagine otherwise by refusing the fantasy of exodus, a withdrawal from a given political, economic, or cultural system predicated on the notion that there is a neutral external vantage point from which one can begin the work of critical assessment. In a very general sense we might term such work immanent critique: art-activism operating within a given structure and inhabiting a particular perspectival frame" (Raley 2013, 135)

#### Jones
TECHNOPHENOMENOLOGICAL
>The body is not "surface" representation to be performed with or against the grain of some core identity nor as pure immanence that can be transcended through thought or virtual technologies, but rather complex enactment of the mortal, and ultimately corruptible and finite, self. The body/ self is technophenomenological: fully mediated through the vicissitudes of bio- and communications technologies, and fully engaged with the social (what Merleau-Ponty would call "enworlded"). The body /self is hymenal, reversible, simultaneously both subject and object” (Jones 1998, 235)

expands technophenomenological, body practices help ground our interrelationality
>"[This kind of work] ultimately points to an expansion of the phenomenological relation to a technophenomenological relation that intertwines intersubjectivity with interobjectivity: we are enworlded via the envelopment of our bodies in space, the touch of our hands on a keyboard, the stroke of our gaze on the video screen. Seemingly paradoxically, given the conventional association of technology with disembodiment and disengagement from the world, recent body-oriented practices have increasingly mobilized and highlighted this reversibility, using the artists' own body/self as both subject and object, as multiplicitous, particular, and unfixable, and engaging with audiences in increasingly interactive ways. [...] Rather than projecting immanence onto the other, such a practice embraces the flesh (but specifically as enworlded and intersubjectively determined rather than somehow "essential" or in itself transcendent). ” (Jones 1998, 239)
**also makes it political**
>"Such an acknowledgment forces us to experience ourselves as not only in the  world, but as also belonging to it and thus owing it something: as fully contingent bodies/selves who are responsible for the effects our behaviors and perceptions have on others and aware of our reactions to other subjects and objects in the world. This technophenomenological understanding of the body/ self poses it as deeply socialized and politicized” (Jones 1998, 239–240).

ppl connect through tech, interobjectivity
>“high-tech media act via interfaces that mark the artwork as a site of the exchange between subjects, the site of joining between subjects and objects, the locus where intersubjectivity reverses into what Vivian Sobchack has called interobjectvity vice versa” (Jones 1998, 236)

self performance engages self with other, why artist performance w tech matters
>“it is the very narcissism of the performance of the self that inexorably engages the self in the other: our self-conception, our self-performance can only take place through our phenomenological assumption of subjectivity (or moments of subjective engagement) via others in the world” (Jones 1998, 238)

unfixed self in later body art entangled with tech
>“While the earlier artists had focused obsessively (if, in the case of the male artists, often unconsciously or uncritically) on the body's role in self-other relations through structures of narcissism and the rhetoric of the pose, these younger artists tend to explore the body/ self as technologized, specifically unnatural,and fundamentally unfixable in identity or subjective/ objective meaning in the world: [...] This "posthuman" body/self is thoroughly particularized, its gender, sexuality, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, class, and other identifications insistently enunciated within the intersubjective structures established by the body-oriented practice” (Jones 1998, 199).


What Jones calls “body art” are “a set of performative practices that, through such intersubjective engagement, instantiate the dislocation or decentering of the Cartesian subject of modernism.” 
However, not a body that is set off from an original "authentic body"
>“No ‘original’ body is assumed at any point of such a project, no body to be ‘freed’ from opp essive representations (as would have been the case in much early feminist body art and theories of representation)” (Jones 1998, 200) 
>“body art projects can develop a new (implicitly feminist) reading praxis that is suspicious of the assumptions and privileges embedded in and veiled by conventional, masculinist models of artistic interpretation” (Jones 1998, 15) _and cultural ...being?_

her claim is speculative, hopeful
>“this claim is rather utopian; the effects of these works will of course depend on how they are contextualized and who experiences and engages with them” (Jones 1998, 203).

Rebecca Horn's 1974 performance with her "Finger Gloves"

<!-- [![horn-fingers]()](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/horn-finger-gloves-t07845) -->
["Horn has described how wearing these gloves altered her relationship with her surroundings, so that distant objects came within her reach: ‘the finger gloves are light. I can move them without any effort. Feel, touch, grasp anything, but keeping a certain distance from the objects. The lever-action of the lengthened fingers intensifies the various sense-data of the hand; [...] I feel me touching, I see me grasping, I control the distance between me and the objects.’" --Tate gallery label, 2016](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/horn-finger-gloves-t07845)

["Strapped around the face, this mask transforms the wearer’s head into an instrument for drawing. Horn has described wearing it: ‘All pencils are about two inches long and produce the profile of my face in three dimensions...I move my body rhythmically from left to right in front of a white wall. The pencils make marks on the wall the image of which corresponds to the rhythm of my movements.’ The spike-like pencils make this one of Horn’s more threatening works. However, it is linked to the feather masks, as feather quills were also once used for writing." --Tate gallery label, 2004](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/horn-pencil-mask-t07847)

This work is a further step in that project because in order to build this site I learned to connect programmatically to the live data outputs my personal trackers are producing using their APIs (previous projects had used downloaded static data in CSVs rather than live updating). This will allow me to build future projects that act on the data they pull on the fly, whether manipulating it aesthetically or analytically.

#### other quotes maybe

>“If matter itself is lively, then not only is the difference between subjects and objects minimized, but the status of the shared materiality of all things is elevated. All bodies become more than mere objects, as the thing-powers of resistance and protean agency are brought into sharper relief. Vital materialism would thus set up a kind of safety net for those humans who are now, in a world where Kantian morality is the standard, routinely made to suffer because they do not conform to a particular (Euro-American, bourgeois, theocentric, or other) model of personhood. The ethical aim becomes to distribute value more generously, to bodies as such” (Bennett 2010, 13) differs from OOO all objects are impenetrable abstractions

>"But how can we define a ritual as ancient as the Agnicayana as algorithmic? To many, it may appear an act of cultural appropriation to read ancient cultures through the paradigm of the latest technologies. Nevertheless, claiming that abstract techniques of knowledge and artificial metalanguages belong uniquely to the modern industrial West is not only historically inaccurate but also an act and one of implicit _epistemic colonialism_ towards cultures of other places and other times. The French mathematician Jean-Luc Chabert has noted that “algorithms have been around since the beginning of time and existed well before a special word had been coined to describe them. Algorithms are simply a set of step by step instructions, to be carried out quite mechanically, so as to achieve some desired result.” Today some may see algorithms as a recent technological innovation implementing abstract mathematical principles. On the contrary, algorithms are among the most ancient and material practices, predating many human tools and all modern machines" (Pasquinelli 2019)
