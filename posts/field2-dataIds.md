#### exam question

In this section you ask (as a parenthetical “bonus” question) why data extracted and produced in the course of everyday engagements with “algorithmic systems” should even be called “’mine,’ given their complicated histories, trajectories, and impacts?” I’m particularly interested here in their “histories,” which encompass in your argument both extreme brutality (e.g. quantitative techniques developed within the transatlantic slave trade) and more “subversive” possibilities (you give the example here of paper diaries). I would like to hear much more from you about historical antecedents to contemporary hybrid (creative/critical/technical) practices and how they both blur into and are distinct from those practices. I would especially like to hear, time permitting, about how “overshadowed” forms (like diaries, among others) might have informed your own creative practice, or that of your artistic contemporaries.

What does an arts-based approach bring to the discussion of data and self, and what specific critique or subversive strategy can it provide to the datafied subject and data colonialism? // from the first use of personal sensor data in human performance to more recent use for recommendation systems and the eventual appearance of what has been called the 'algorithmic self.'

## Quotes I haven't used yet

### Historical to Contemporary, Brutal to Subversive, Surveillance & Susveillance

#### Mejias & Couldry / Contemp

newly ready to be commodified and extracted
>"data colonialism is changing society by transforming human life into a new abstracted social form that is also ripe for commodification: data. The means for this transformation are---to reiterate--not labor relations, but, more broadly, commodified social relations, or, more succinctly, data relations” (Couldry and Mejias 2019, 343). … “These new types of social relations implicate human beings in processes of data extraction, but in ways that do not _prima facie_ seem extractive. That is the key point: the audacious yet largely disguised corporate attempt to incorporate all of life, whether or not conceived by those doing it as “production,” into an expanded process for the generation of surplus value. The extraction of data from bodies, things, and systems create new possibilities for managing everything. This is the new and distinctive role of platforms and other environments of routine data extraction” (Couldry and Mejias 2019, 343).

unfortunately humans are still attached to these data bodies, the stakes are material
>“Even though the new social knowledge is produced through operations that bypass human beings, it is actual human beings, not “doubles,” who are tethered to the discriminations that such knowledge generates. It is a real person who gets offered a favorable price in the supermarket, an opportunity for social housing, or a legal penalty, all based on algorithmic reasoning” (Couldry and Mejias 2019, 344)

this is not natural or rational, but capitalist and motivated, for powerful interests
>“[...Resistance to data colonialism [...] rejects the idea that the continuous collection of data from human beings is natural, let alone rational; and so rejects the idea that the results of data processing are a naturally occurring form of social knowledge, rather than a commercially motivated form of extraction that advances particular economic and/or governance interests” (Couldry and Mejias 2019, 346)



#### Weheliye
race is for racism
>“the biopolitical function of race is racism” (Weheliye 2014, 42).

naturalized to create human /nonhuman > racialization
>“Despite having no real basis in biochemistry, the hieroglyphics of the flesh requires grounding in the biological sphere so as to facilitate—even as it conceals and because it masks—the political, economic, social, and cultural disciplining (semiosis of procedure) of the Homo sapiens species into assemblages of the human, not-quite-human, and nonhuman; this is what I am referring to as racialization” (Weheliye 2014, 33).

critique of posthumanism
>“many invocations of posthumanism, whether in antihumanist post-structuralist theorizing or in current considerations of technology and animality, reinscribe the humanist subject (Man) as the personification of the human by insisting that this is the category to be overcome, rarely considering cultural and political formations outside the world of Man that might offer alternative versions of humanity. 18 Moreover, posthumanism and animal studies isomorphically yoke humanity to the limited possessive individualism of Man, because these discourses also presume that we have now entered a stage in human development where all subjects have been granted equal access to western humanity and that this is, indeed, what we all want to overcome” (Weheliye 2014, 15).


#### Browne

>“biometrics is a technology of measuring the living body. The application of this technology is in the verification, identification, and automation practices that enable the body to function as evidence” (S Browne 2015, 109).

>“Importantly, a critical biometric consciousness must acknowledge the connections between contemporary biometric information technologies and their historical antecedents. Meaning here that this critical biometric consciousness must contend with the ways that branding, particularly within racial slavery, was instituted as a means of population management that rendered whiteness prototypical through its making, marking, and marketing of blackness as visible and as commodity. As well, it must contend with the ways in which branding was a form of punishment and racial profiling” (S Browne 2015, 118).

Along with ex-slave narratives, plantation rules, the census, runaway advertisements, ship manifests, and other documents of the transatlantic slave trade, Browne details how branding was "a biometric technology, as it was a measure of slavery’s making, marking, and marketing of the black subject as commodity" (91). Further, "the branding of blackness remains visible, and also makes certain brands visible" (92). She says, branding is not only "a material practice of hot irons on skin, but as a racializing act, where the one-drop rule was a technology of branding blackness that maintained the enslaved body as black" (92).



>“the tracking of blackness as property informs the contemporary surveillance of the racial body [...] questioning how the intimate relation between branding and the black body---our biometric past---can allow us to think critically about our biometric present” (S Browne 2015, 91)

def souveillance, as critique as praxis, historical and contemporary 
>“Dark sousveillance, then, plots imaginaries that are oppositional and that are hopeful for another way of being. Dark sousveillance is a site of critique, as it speaks to black epistemologies of contending with antiblack surveillance, where the tools of social control in plantation surveillance or lantern laws in city spaces and beyond were appropriated, co-opted, repurposed, and challenged in order to facilitate survival and escape. [...] Dark sousveillance is also a reading praxis for examining surveillance that allows for a questioning of how certain surveillance technologies installed during slavery to monitor and track blackness as property (for example, branding, the one-drop rule, quantitative plantation records that listed enslaved people alongside livestock and crops, slave passes, slave patrols, and runaway notices) anticipate the contemporary surveillance of racialized subjects, and it also provides a way to frame how the contemporary surveillance of the racial body might be contended with” (S Browne 2015, 22–24)

"The historical formation of surveillance is not outside of the historical formation of slavery." "narratives of ex-slaves, runaway slave advertisements, the census, and a set of plantation rules" (Browne 2015, 50)

>"Through their detailing of physical descriptions, the surveillance technology of the runaway slave advertisement was put to use to make the already hypervisible racial subject legible [...] Sall’s ability to evade surveillance through makeup, wicked tricks, and hiding in plain sight exposes the one-drop rule as a social construction that, for some, could be subverted by performing whiteness. Seth’s, or sometimes Sall’s, hiding in plain sightby identifying as white and using an alias—was a freedom practice to evade surveillance, and in so being a form of dark sousveillance." (Browne 2015, 54)
>"With Craft, her passing in terms of race, passing in terms of gender, passing in terms of class, and passing in terms of disability all played a role in her and William’s passing into freedom" (55).

>"In the United States, racial nomenclature as a form of population management was made official with the taking of the first federal census in 1790, [...] by way of formalized categories that fix individuals within a certain time and a particular space, making the census a technology that renders a population legible in racializing as well as gendering ways." (Browne 55--56) (_combined 2 ideas could resplit_) "it was left to the census taker to judge whether the census informant’s claim to the category of whiteness was valid, rather than accepting at face value the informant’s self-identification as white." (56)

>"commodity racism, that being to consume while at the same time alienating blackness. 55 Collecting and consuming blackness, and black people, whether kitsch or corporeal, forms part of the larger history continuing to the present of the ritualized practices and trauma of white supremacy, as the archive of lynching makes plain. After such extrajudicial killings and the ceremony that accompanied death, memorabilia would be taken, and oftentimes sold, as souvenirs" _blackness for sale, net.art not addressing race. browser names_

>

Browne points to the hobbiest botanical classification and other scientific and pseudoscientific taxonomies occuring alongside this human classification, exploitation, and economic trade: "human categorization and division is part of a larger imperial project of colonial expansion that aimed to fix, frame, and naturalize discursively constructed difference" (Browne 2015, 96). The main operational mode of computation as it is understood today is classification/categorization, which when taken as the main metaphor for contemporary thought continue to "naturalize discursively constructed difference." Computation and data, it could be argued, are part of the imperialist project. It may be possible to imagine other forms of computation not built on concepts of binary classification (down to the level of voltage and switches), but perhaps not within a culture built on and so deeply invested in these values. 

Browne refers to "digital epidermalization" as what happens to certain bodies when "algorithms are the computational means through which the body, or more specifically parts, pieces, and, increasingly, performances of the body are mathematically coded as data, making for unique templates for computers to then sort [...], or to verify the identity [...,] also used for automation [..., or] to detect a user’s presence and gestures" (109). The effect of digital epidermalization is potentially alienation from the self and profound precarity, she says, at borders or voting booths, welfare offices or prisons, "moments where identification, and increasingly biometric information, is required to speak the truth of and for muted bodies. These sites and moments are productive of, and often necessitate, ontological insecurity" (110). Digital epidermalization in these moments can override one's own truth about oneself.

~~>"Digital epidermalization is the exercise of power cast by the disembodied gaze of certain surveillance technologies (for example, identity card readers and e-passport verification machines) that can be employed to do the work of alienating the subject by producing a truth about the racial body and one’s identity (or identities) despite the subject’s claims” (2015, 110).~~

Siri's history is militaristic
>“Siri and its antecedents had been in development for nearly a decade through the largest artificial intelligence project ever funded by the U.S. government, drawing over $150 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). [...] Siri’s precursor was designed to help field commanders who have to manage complex data and bureaucracy while remaining focused on strategic challenges. CALO was inspired by the Latin calonis, or soldier’s servant, giving a very different cast to its imagined cultural role: more executive officer than personal assistant” (Finn 2017, 57–58).
“The original Siri also had a sharper edge to its dialog, occasionally deploying four-letter words and plenty of attitude, which was part of its appeal for Jobs (though Apple quickly dialed down the software’s affect in-house). The software didn’t just know things, it was also knowing” (Finn 2017, 62)
“These fragments of interaction contribute to Siri’s adaptive learning curve, as if thousands or millions of dialect speakers are all passively educating the same virtual toddler in correct pronunciation, while the Siri interface at the same time shapes the inflections of those users, encouraging them to enunciate in specific, machine-legible ways and creating a kind of collaborative human–machine distribution curve of language” (Finn 2017, 63) field1

intimacies required for expanded self, creepvenience
>“We desire algorithms that truly know us and tell our stories. Anticipation requires intimacy.” (Finn 2017, 75)
>“we are hard at work constructing intimacy with algorithms, from our willingness to play along with Siri to the things we type into search bars when we think nobody is looking. We interact with search interfaces in intensely private ways—a strange, occasionally grotesque confessionalism at the altar of computation” (Finn 2017, 75)
>“This is [marketed as] a form of algorithmic proprioception, an expansion of the self, enabled by physical and cognitive sensors and feedback loops” (Finn 2017, 77).
>“Turing’s provocation asks us to consider intelligence and identity as different forms of the same boundary question, one that explores the physical and intellectual edges of selfhood” (Finn 2017, 80)

interface as barrier and doing the work of empathy
>“The sharing economy ultimately depends on an atomized form of intimacy, a series of fleeting, close encounters with strangers that are managed and underwritten (in emotional, financial, and liability terms) by algorithmic culture machines. [...] The real sell is the interface itself: the experience of computationally mediated culture and its underlying algorithmic simplification and abstraction” (Finn 2017, 129).
“The interface layer acts as a baffle or shock absorber, diffusing common socioeconomic barriers like class, gender, and race through the magic of five-star ratings and computationally validated trust. This form of arbitrage is a sophisticated triangulation of intimacies, asking participants to trade in or renegotiate certain facets of identity in favor of algorithmically crafted substitutes. [...] we outsource the determination of bias, of commercial viability, indeed of context itself, to the algorithm, asking the interface layer to do not just the logistical but the ethical and cultural work for us.” (Finn 2017, 130)

ethical issues and physicality for the workers that is obscured through the cloud, using wearable tech
>“The cloud seems physically intangible even as it serves to cover or obscure these layers of abstraction and human labor behind the spectacle of computation,” (Finn 2017, 132)... key paradox where virtual material overlap “But for the workers servicing these warehouses, the architecture of step-counting, numerical targets, and other game mechanics embody the realities of that idealized, game-like narrative across real space and real lives. The cloud functions as an opaque membrane deflecting public attention, ethical inquiries, and legal liability, so we can all continue playing the online shopping game with no obligation, and few opportunities, to empathize or interact with a human being” (Finn 2017, 133)

pretend AI is human labor, behind the computational layer of interface
>“marks the reversal of the computational instrument: now human brains are the black box, strung together into an ad-hoc network of wetware servers for odd jobs” (Finn 2017, 138)

could compare all these to the shipping manifests of the trade of enslaved peoples

#### Wernimont
>“the kinds of labor that the body-being-counted does for others” (Wernimont 2018, 9)
normalizing, who counts, moral status
>“matrices of bodies and media” (Wernimont 2018, 4)
**more in book, get from pdf**

Wernimont uses the metaphor of the matrices as “the media in which something is generated or developed. As a generative form, the matrix is a powerful way of understanding and critiquing binary logics and simple, progressive narratives” (11). Citing Vivian M. May, she says it also grounds intersectional practice and thought, “intersectional work focuses on 'enmeshed multiplicities,' including but not limited to those of race and gender. It also entails a commitment to ‘resistant forms of knowing’ [...]. The matrix logic of intersectional feminism ‘considers how inequalities intermingle,’ and stresses linkages between ‘the structural and experiential, and the material and the discursive’” (Wernimont 2018,  11).

#### Wissinger

reproduce assumptions about women
>“three prevalent assumptions about women in the tech/ fashion field. First, women are potential victims. Second, women want to achieve difficult-to-attain physical ideals of health and optimum fitness. Third, women need to be constantly available and connected virtually, while also paying close attention to achieving high-level face-to-face interaction with those they are with, thus staying fully connected and totally present, at the same time” (Wissinger 2017, 373) 

victimhood, products contstruct identities specifically gendered, reproduce cultural anxieties
>“Whether susceptible to a snack attack, or a literal attack, the assumed potential victimhood of bodies gendered female is a telling illustration of broader cultural anxieties being reproduced within these new technologies, anxieties that feed into the identities these technologies are helping to construct” (Wissinger 2017, 374)


>"The need to return to face-to-face contact resonates with assumptions about femininity regarding emotional availability. Both women and men are suffering from technologically induced reductions in eye contact; attentiveness and availability to others’ needs, however, are behaviors traditionally coded feminine [...] with attention to herself significantly missing from that list” (Wissinger 2017, 380)

### Artists

#### Raley
artists use dataveillance for why
>"Artists who appropriate dataveillance techniques and tools as a medium for creative production inform, enlighten, and help us to imagine otherwise by refusing the fantasy of exodus, a withdrawal from a given political, economic, or cultural system predicated on the notion that there is a neutral external vantage point from which one can begin the work of critical assessment. In a very general sense we might term such work immanent critique: art-activism operating within a given structure and inhabiting a particular perspectival frame" (Raley 2013, 135)

#### Jones
TECHNOPHENOMENOLOGICAL
>The body is not "surface" representation to be performed with or against the grain of some core identity nor as pure immanence that can be transcended through thought or virtual technologies, but rather complex enactment of the mortal, and ultimately corruptible and finite, self. The body/ self is technophenomenological: fully mediated through the vicissitudes of bio- and communications technologies, and fully engaged with the social (what Merleau-Ponty would call "enworlded"). The body /self is hymenal, reversible, simultaneously both subject and object” (Jones 1998, 235)

expands technophenomenological, body practices help ground our interrelationality
>"[This kind of work] ultimately points to an expansion of the phenomenological relation to a technophenomenological relation that intertwines intersubjectivity with interobjectivity: we are enworlded via the envelopment of our bodies in space, the touch of our hands on a keyboard, the stroke of our gaze on the video screen. Seemingly paradoxically, given the conventional association of technology with disembodiment and disengagement from the world, recent body-oriented practices have increasingly mobilized and highlighted this reversibility, using the artists' own body/self as both subject and object, as multiplicitous, particular, and unfixable, and engaging with audiences in increasingly interactive ways. [...] Rather than projecting immanence onto the other, such a practice embraces the flesh (but specifically as enworlded and intersubjectively determined rather than somehow "essential" or in itself transcendent). ” (Jones 1998, 239)
**also makes it political**
>"Such an acknowledgment forces us to experience ourselves as not only in the  world, but as also belonging to it and thus owing it something: as fully contingent bodies/selves who are responsible for the effects our behaviors and perceptions have on others and aware of our reactions to other subjects and objects in the world. This technophenomenological understanding of the body/ self poses it as deeply socialized and politicized” (Jones 1998, 239–240).

ppl connect through tech, interobjectivity
>“high-tech media act via interfaces that mark the artwork as a site of the exchange between subjects, the site of joining between subjects and objects, the locus where intersubjectivity reverses into what Vivian Sobchack has called interobjectvity vice versa” (Jones 1998, 236)

self performance engages self with other, why artist performance w tech matters
>“it is the very narcissism of the performance of the self that inexorably engages the self in the other: our self-conception, our self-performance can only take place through our phenomenological assumption of subjectivity (or moments of subjective engagement) via others in the world” (Jones 1998, 238)

unfixed self in later body art entangled with tech
>“While the earlier artists had focused obsessively (if, in the case of the male artists, often unconsciously or uncritically) on the body's role in self-other relations through structures of narcissism and the rhetoric of the pose, these younger artists tend to explore the body/ self as technologized, specifically unnatural,and fundamentally unfixable in identity or subjective/ objective meaning in the world: [...] This "posthuman" body/self is thoroughly particularized, its gender, sexuality, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, class, and other identifications insistently enunciated within the intersubjective structures established by the body-oriented practice” (Jones 1998, 199).


What Jones calls “body art” are “a set of performative practices that, through such intersubjective engagement, instantiate the dislocation or decentering of the Cartesian subject of modernism.” 
However, not a body that is set off from an original "authentic body"
>“No ‘original’ body is assumed at any point of such a project, no body to be ‘freed’ from opp essive representations (as would have been the case in much early feminist body art and theories of representation)” (Jones 1998, 200) 
>“body art projects can develop a new (implicitly feminist) reading praxis that is suspicious of the assumptions and privileges embedded in and veiled by conventional, masculinist models of artistic interpretation” (Jones 1998, 15) _and cultural ...being?_

her claim is speculative, hopeful
>“this claim is rather utopian; the effects of these works will of course depend on how they are contextualized and who experiences and engages with them” (Jones 1998, 203).

#### other quotes maybe

“If matter itself is lively, then not only is the difference between subjects and objects minimized, but the status of the shared materiality of all things is elevated. All bodies become more than mere objects, as the thing-powers of resistance and protean agency are brought into sharper relief. Vital materialism would thus set up a kind of safety net for those humans who are now, in a world where Kantian morality is the standard, routinely made to suffer because they do not conform to a particular (Euro-American, bourgeois, theocentric, or other) model of personhood. The ethical aim becomes to distribute value more generously, to bodies as such” (Bennett 2010, 13) differs from OOO all objects are impenetrable abstractions
