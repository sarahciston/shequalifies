# co-writing with algorithms

#### exam question

_In your description for Field I, you note your interest in “the entanglements of self/other/technology” and how these entanglements “get enacted, distributed, absorbed, and reworked.” The writers that you have included on your list have very different views regarding these entanglements, especially as they relate to code and software. As Wendy Chun writes, for example, the “relationship among code and interface, action and result is always contingent and always to some extent imagined.” She goes on to outline an argument for code as fetish, as sourcery, and as re-source by emphasizing the gap between source and execution. Choose at least three central thinkers from your list and describe their articulations of the entanglements of self/other/technology/code/software. If it’s useful, include examples from your list of artworks as well, and/or discuss the framework you created to respond to your exam questions. What does it allow you to enact in relationship to this field? What entanglement(s) are you hoping to create?_

## 0. introduction

Through this writing, combining approaches from the scholarship in this field, I argue for an approach to code language that is specific, entangled, multiply situated, and emergent. Most of the theorists across media studies, software studies, and related fields whom I'll discuss here share a common argument that 1) some distinction is to be made between code language and 'natural' or 'human' language, 2) that there are distinctions between the levels or types of code languages that constitute a more complete computational system (usually differentiated by their degree of abstraction away from binary or machinic understanding and toward human understanding or interface)

Each theorist may define their terms and draw the boundaries between them in different places, and raise different stakes on the nuanced distinctions, which I will detail further; however, a primary shared concern remains to unpack the relationships between parts of these complex systems---networked human-machine social assemblages--which their complexity obscures. While abstraction can be necessary to operate (hard to drive a car if thinking about all the ways it works at once), when abstraction contributes to mystification and loss of agency from the belief we cannot understand or alter systems, encapsulation and individualism and the transfer of agency to abstract inanimate objects, or power consolidation that narrows possibilities as they are privatized, among other things.

First I will discuss how several authors have characterized the distinct properties of code language, describing how they may intersect or conflict. Then I will outline my framing of a more porous relationship of languages (both coded and natural), other technological tools, selves, and others. Finally, I will draw on examples from my own body of artistic research practice as well as from historical and contemporary artists to discuss what kinds of artworks and entanglements,  this framework potentially produces for the field---in particular by revealing how obfuscated aspects of these systems work, by finding emergent possibilities in the gaps and excesses, or by pointing to alternative phenomenologies to consider.[^Logs]

## 1. specificity

>_Within the field of networked and programmable media, at the very least, we can acknowledge: machine codes, tokenized codes, low-level languages, high-level languages, scripting languages, macro languages, markup languages, operating systems and their scripting language, the human–computer interface (HCI), the procedural descriptions of software manuals, and a very large number of texts addressed to entirely human concerns._ (Cayley 2018, 56)

### 1.1 layers & gaps, abstraction & obfuscation

When someone says 'code' they might be referring to any number of kinds of writing intended for machines, and possibly people, to interpret. Many of these types of code may be running in the same system, most types have a variety of languages and even dialects to choose from, and may be used for different purposes or genres, and written in different styles---which means that, at each juncture of design and implementation, their human designers must make choices, informed by culture, context, training, and understood goals. To say, "it's just code" or "it's hard-coded" or "the computer decided" erases both the hundreds of human decisions and the likely millions of binary decisions involved. 

Just as the humanities has strong close-reading practices to analyze text and paratext for many other forms of media, these types of code should be read for all their stylistic and contextualized choices. The Critical Code Studies approach, established by Mark Marino (2006), views code "as already having meaning beyond its functionality since it is a form of symbolic expression and interaction.” He argues, further, "there are implications in the way a code tries to perform a function that bear the imprint of epistemologies, cultural assumptions about gender, race and sexuality; economic philosophies; and political paradigms. This brief litany does not begin to get at the more computer-specific issues." This view of code(s) begins to demonstrate a) the distinctions between types of codes, b) the paratextual and social/cultural aspects that code also carries, and c) some ways code may have more in common with other forms of writing than it is generally assumed. Marino says, "code is not merely instrumental but rather a performative, transformative, mediating process."

So, while I may say "code" or "software" or "computation" and sometimes I may say it to avoid saying exactly what I mean... the things that code is include _many_ layers. And there are _many, many_ layers of conflation happening in the cultural conceptions of code, which at their extreme tend to mystify any specific computational media object one could otherwise  engaged: “interfaces stand in, more often than not, for the computer itself, erasing the medium” (Chun 2008, 318). 

The mystery and power associated with technology (or tools, and perhaps in particular with language tools) precedes computation, of course. Florian Cramer (2005), tracing the history of executable language, says at the outset, “technology is semantic, ecstatic and magic” (18). This religious (or at least inexplicably powerful) quality is the focus of Wendy H. K. Chun's (2008) critique: “The reduction of computer to source code, combined with the belief that users run our computers, makes us vulnerable to fantastic tales of the power of computing. To break free of this sourcery, we need to interrogate, rather than venerate or even accept, the grounding or logic of software” (300). She begins to interrogate this logic by distinguishing the language of code from the additional processes required to put it into action and from the results of those actions, plus explaining in part why these distinctions matter: 

>The goal of software is to conflate an event with a written command. Software blurs the difference among human-readable code (readable because of another program), its machine-readable interpretation, and its execution by turning the word "program" from a verb to a noun, [...] by turning execution into inscription---or at least attempting to do so. [...T]his conflation of instruction or command with its product is also linked to software’s gendered, military history: in the military, there is supposed to be no difference between a command given and a command completed, especially to a "girl." (303–304)

By flattening the software--hardware infrastructure and shifting from verb to noun, Chun seems to argue that a static inevitability or obscure magic replaces or simplifies the agency, or transfers it to the black box and away from potential interventions. It would be fascinating to expand on this linguistic interpretation by contrasting it with Nathaniel Mackey's (1992) "Other: From Noun to Verb," which in part discusses Amiri Baraka's "poetics of process": "The sense he advances that 'this verb value'" is an impulse to 'make words surprise themselves'" (60). While that is perhaps outside the scope here, I recognize and value the attention to word choice and tracing such slippages, which often go unnoted but carry material and epistemological repercussions. 

These repercussions do not stop at readable code or at the digital, but are felt across all the computational layers described by the scholars discussed here. While Chun disentangles the specificity of each layer from another, her argument suggests that this more nuanced understanding supports reckoning with the complexly entangled relationships between these layers and cultural systems/individuals they affect: 

>This erasure of the vicissitudes of execution coincides with the conflation of data with information, information with knowledge---the assumption that what’s most difficult is the capture, rather than the analysis, of data. This erasure of execution through source code as source creates an intentional authorial subject: the computer, the program, or the user, and this source is treated as the source of meaning. (316)

With the loss of the "vicissitudes of execution," she claims, the archetype of the user and of the computer are imbued with undue meaning and agency, without the context of the operations that support---and more importantly influence, shape, and limit---that agency. 

### 1.2 material & ephemeral, entanglement and estrangement

This problem is not exclusively digital, computational, or contemporary. Sadie Plant (1998), in her cyberfeminist history of computing, describes how the material of weaving became estranged from the practice of weaving: 

>whereas the weave was once both the process and the product, the woven stuff, images are now separated out from matrices to which they had been immanent. The artist sees only the surface of a web which is covered as he works; the paper on which authors now look down has no say in the writing it supports. <span class="purple-inline">_The processes themselves become dematerialized as myths, legends, and metaphors_.</span> (68, emphasis added)

Dennis Tenen (2017) draws attention to a not-dissimilar gap created by the presentation of texts in digital formats: "A substantial gap separates visible text from its storage medium. The two sites of inscription, screen and electromagnetic storage, are physically incongruent. One must be translated, transformed into the other" (9). Later builds on the implications of this estrangement by suggesting that this is what contributes to digital texts seeming ephemeral: "The inscription passes from view. The sign reappears again on-screen, already processed, that is, altered by the intervention of control units. Reading no longer identiﬁes solitary, self-directed activity. Machine operators far removed from the site of interpretation intervene between readers, writers, and texts” (102).

These gaps between inscription and execution, between representation layer and storage medium, text and paper, do not mean however that these works are merely immaterial information, as is often assumed about digital objects or about language in general. N. Katherine Hayles (2005) argues that in fact the materiality of such works is produced _through_ their unique combination of physical properties and linguistic strategies---pointing to a richer relationship between materiality and meaning: "materiality [...] cannot simply be collapsed into physicality but is an emergent property generated by interactions between a work's signifying strategies and the physical characteristics it mobilizes as resources for its operations" (9). She builds on this expanded definition of materiality as a call for other kinds of entanglements as well. She suggests not only "complex transactions between bodies and texts as well as between different forms of media" (7), but also "different models of subjectivity than those usually assumed in textual editing, as well as changed concepts of how embodied texts relate to one another" (9). Hayles traces certain continuities across analog and digital media, and lays out many of the primary concerns for scholars for the next decades. While the entanglements she outlines more broadly across media are useful, when discussing code the specifics tend to tangle. 

### 1.3 citational is relational

Where Chun aims to disentangle the specifics of code as noun and verb, object and action, Hayles wants to re-emphasize the entanglement of physical object and signification in their co-roles for materiality, and the entanglement of texts with each other. Both are interested code as performative or as "speech act" or more broadly as performative. In contrast to Chun's specificity, Hayles perhaps overentangles or overemphasizes the executable aspect of code language (as performative) at the expense of the other processes involved. 

Hayles portrays code as distinct type of language because it enacts itself, and she details further differences between code languages and other human languages, including, "Nor does code allow the infinite iterability and citation that Derrida associates with inscriptions, whereby any phrase, sentence, or paragraph can be lifted from one context and embedded in another" (48). While I argue examples like Git versioning, StackExchange, object-oriented programming, the Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) ethos, and maybe even the concept of variables could be counterpoints to this, as each allows for lifting, embedding, reiterating, and citing practices. Meanwhile Chun points directly to the citational nature of code, rather than just its executability, that makes it performative:  

>understanding code as re-source links its effectiveness to history and context. <span class="purple-inline">_If code is performative, it is because of the community (human and otherwise) that enables such utterances to be repeated and executed, that one joins through such citation._</span> [...] what is crucial to a performative utterance’s success or failure is its iterability, [...] What is crucial here is: first, code that succeeds must be citations---and extremely exact citations at that. <span class="purple-inline">_There is no room for syntax errors_;</span> second, that <span class="purple-inline">_this iterability precedes the so-called subject (or machine) that is supposedly the source of the code_;</span> and third, and most importantly, <span class="purple-inline">_an entire structure must be in place in order for a command to be executed. This structure is as institutional and political as it is machinic._</span> (322, emphasis added)

While I will discuss later where I think error may emerge as a useful component, I support the citational, iterable view of code that situates it in context of its human creators and audiences, as well as within technological infrastructures. This view also connects it to other writing practices, community practices, and subjects; and it connects the iterable, recursive properties of code to its perforative, interpellating properties. 

I would maintain the need for some specificity that can parse differences between digital and analog, between coding languages and other human languages, but not so much that insists upon ignoring their commonalities or granting those differences too much power or magic, erasing our human roles and agency in the process. Rather, I am interested in how these living languages may operate across a spectrum and influence each other as they evolve together.

## 2. entanglement

>_To anyone trained in this way [learning writing by copying letterforms] the edges of letters are memorable, emotional places, and remain so._ (Carson 1998, 57)

### 2.1 self--other--technology systems

The work of clarifying code and its position(s) in computational and cultural systems also helps clarify its entangled relationships with individuals, as Chun and Hayles began to touch on above. Viewing self--others--tech as a messy interrelated set of systems is important as the frequency of digital encounters nears continuous and as the impact and influence of digital languages and other technological objects grows:

>This may seem strange at ﬁrst: to recover the subject in the physical minutiae of the encounter between text and machine. The point of contact between human, text, and device is signiﬁcant because it is in the liminal zone of semiotic exchange where subjects disappear into machines and where machines step forth as animated and seemingly intelligent actors. Our ability to apprehend the politics of smart objects depends on the formulation of their poetics: how they are made. (Tenen 2017, 10)

Again, and as Tenen (2017) argues here, allowing the 'subject' to disavow agency as we imagine the 'machine' acquires it is a dangerous obfuscation of the how and what of computing. Here, in this "liminal zone of semiotic exchange" where human, text, and device make contact, I would argue that subjects do not disappear but are produced or reconstituted as yet-again individuated, performative, digital.[^reader-writer]

[^reader-writer]: As I have written about elsewhere, they are also produced as reader-as-writer (citation ELO 2018 TK).

### 2.2 embodyment from analog continuum to digital discrete

Although almost no one would call writing a digital technology, Anne Carson (1998) traces the emergence of written language through the transition from oral epic poetry to written lyric poetry. Through this process she connects the boundaries drawn between sounds in order to create letters with the boundaries drawn between people and their environments, tools, and each other in order to create their sense of self:

>A written text separates words from one another, separates words from the environment, separates words from the reader (or writer) and separates the reader (or writer) from his environment. Separation is painful. [...] As separable, controllable units of meaning, each with its own visible boundary, each with its own fixed and independent use, written words project their user into isolation. [...] Heard words may have no edges, or varying edges; oral traditions may have no concept of 'word' as a fixed and bounded vocable, or may employ a flexible concept. Homer's word for 'word' (_epos_) includes the meanings 'speech,' 'tale,' 'song,' 'line of verse' or 'epic poetry as a whole.' All are breathable. The edges are irrelevant. (50)

In this breathable, expandable definition of oral language, it seems a more porous sense of self prevailed. It was not until exposure to "a written alphabet and the demands of literacy" that focus shifted to "deliberate meditation upon the self" and "a heightened awareness of personal physical boundaries and a sense of those boundaries as the vessel of one's self. To control the boundaries is to possess oneself” (44). The paradigm shift from speech to writing is evident in the move from the epic to the lyric. Carson marks fragmentation, disjointed rhythm and flow: 

>we see people struck by new ways of thinking about edges---the edges of sounds, letters, words, emotions, events in time, selves. This is apparent in the way they use the materials of poetry, as well as in the things they say. Contraction and focus are the mechanism of lyric procedure. [...] Epic formulas of phrase and rhythm pervade lyric poetry, but they are broken apart and differently assembled in irregular shapes and joins. (51)

With the historical perspective of thousands of years, Carson is able to detail how the technological shift adopting written language as a widespread tool created shifts in content and form of media, but also in conceptions of identity itself. If written language was a harbinger of Western individualism, of course it would be an important counterpoint to examine how non-European traditions processed similar transitions perhaps differently. Would another thousand years show contemporary shifts to digital culture as paradigm changing or progressing along the same continuum? My answer is yes. Including written language as one of the forms of technology discussed here expands the context for any 'precedent-setting' change, while also showing the comprehensive imbrication of subjects and tools. 

### 2.3 self is a (relational) technology 

Above, Hayles and Tenen suggest a new understanding of subjectivity through the lens of computation, and Geoff Cox emphasizes the code-like reciprocal nature of the relationship between code and self. His book _Speaking Code_ (2012) does view code as speech act, but also goes further to situate it in relation to political[^pessimistic] and relational subjects: "both subjectivity and code recursively write their own instrumentation. Yet the subject is not simply preprogrammed like a machine but more like code in actively combining internal and external factors, standing between what is possible and what actually exists" (109). This is reminescent of Roland Barthes' (1989) open approach to text, and (while the "death of the author" helped a decade of scholars erase the importance of subjectivity and subject position by pejoratively labeling it "just identity politics") his focus on the interconnectedness and instability of the sign, even and especially with non-digital text, remains useful:

[^pessimistic]: Interestingly, while subscribing to the code-as-speech-act approach, Cox uses its performative qualities to make a pessimistic argument about on how code limits the possibilities for political and collective action (while making those possibilities appear enacted). "[S]cale-free networks like the Internet naturalize the fantasy of global unity, foreclose wider discussions of the underlying command and control structures. Participatory and collective forms of communication and political expression may become part of the very mechanism of guaranteeing their nullification—in the production of empty speech acts." (Cox 2012, 91)

>"The text, only the text," we are told, but "only the text" does not exist: [...] every reading derives from trans-individual forms: the associations engendered by the letter (but where is that letter?) [...] are always caught up (sampled and inserted) by certain codes, certain languages, certain lists of stereotypes. [...] Where do these rules come from? Certainly not from the author, who does nothing but apply them in his own way [...]; visible apart from him, these rules come from an age-old logic of narrative, from a symbolic form which constitutes us even before we are born---in a word, from that vast cultural space through which our person (whether author or reader) is only one passage. [...T]o read is to make our body work [...] at the invitation of the text's signs, of all the languages which traverse it and form something like the shimmering depth of the sentence. (31)

<span class="purple-inline">_To read is to make our body work [...] at the invitation [...] of all the languages which traverse it and form something like the shimmering depth of the sentence._</span> Depending on how we read the phrase, it is our body which forms the sentence, or something like its depth. <span class="purple-inline">_trans-individual forms [...] always caught up_</span> 

The database is one of the most associative forms we have, certainly computationally, and Mark Poster (1995) argues that databases constitute a shift in power and linguistic structure that I would liken to Anne Carson's account of the transition to written language. The catch of being "caught up" here by "certain codes" (Barthes 1989, 31), though, takes on new stakes when amplified digitally. Poster says, “The cultural function of databases is not so much the institution of dominant power structures against the individual but in restructuring the nature of the individual” (93). Poster uses Althusser and Foucault to detail how the subject is hailed differently by a database than by the author of a linear text, in that the writer is often known and the reader chooses to be interpellated; whereas "Interpellation by database is a complicated configuration of unconsciousness, indirection, automation, and absent-mindedness both on the part of the producer of the database and on the part of the individual subject being constituted by it" (90). This shifts the process of identify formation and subjectification within a Foucauldian reading of biopower. In particular he points to the affordances of the relational database that allow data from different databases to be indexed against each other, combined, and redistributed:  

>The process of subject constitution was [once] one of "subjectification," of producing individuals with a (false) sense of their own interiority. With the super-panopticon, on the contrary, subject constitution takes an opposing course of "objectification," of producing individuals with dispersed identities, identities of which the individuals might not even be aware. (93)

This distributed sense of identity is a far cry from the self-contained individualism of rational modernism (and that any of these 20th century authors talk even then of "the subject" as singular and unified with a straight face is beyond me), and Poster suggests its fragmentation by database calls for different politics than for autonomous individuals: "we need to understand the forms of agency appropriate to a dispersed, multiple subject and to generate strategies of resistance appropriate to that 'identity formation'" (93). 

Each of the writers discussed describes the relationship between code and/or technology and subjects that is relational enough to destabilize the notion of a fixed, hermetically sealed individual. Tracing the shifts in conceptions of selfhood as a framework over time do part of the work to help unfix it from its assumed status as natural, rather than another conceptual tool, historically situated. And as technological shifts like the database and other computational forms suggest coincident epistemological shifts (whether literal "distributed cognition" or more broadly the sense of self as tenuously co-constructed, interrelated, contingent), this may even point to a (partial) return to Carson's multi-sensory breathable, expandable self---not one that renders the edges completely irrelevant (we do not want to lose Chun's specificity or to lose the hard-won intersectional subjectivities that specificity allows)---but instead selves that are porous, selves that are in process over time/space, selves that retain their verbs, selves writing themselves. 

## 3. multiply-situated & emergent

>And in these operations [of my own writing] the person "I," whether explicit or implicit, splits into a number of different figures: into an "I" who is writing and an "I" who is written, into an empirical "I" who looks over the shoulder of the "I" who is writing and into a mythical "I" who serves as a model for the "I" who is written. The "I" of the author is dissolved in the writing. The so-called personality of the writer exists within the very act of writing: it is the product and the instrument of the writing process. [...] Writers, as they have always been up to now, are already writing machines; or at least they are when things are going well. (Calvino 1987, 15)

### 3.1 authors & aliens 

Text-generating AI write like Gertrude Stein (2014, 1914), though it is unlikely their intended objective. Famed modernist poet and patron, Stein's writing works like machine writing before machines wrote. It gathers meaning by accretion, relying on the thinking/processing/knowledge base of its reader. It sounds like computer vision at its most plainspoken, im2txt caption generator or GPT-2 before it devolves into fake news rants. The similarity between poet and program makes sense to me because both are about pattern finding, whether image or sound or shape of letterform. The works may appear or feel intuitive to the poet or the blackboxed neural net, but there are patterns and recombinant processes revealed nevertheless: "Act so that there is no use in a center. A wide action is not a width" (Stein 63). And then later, "A willow and no window, a wide place stranger, a wideness makes an active center" (75). Or, "You can say things like, 'It's true,' 'It's true,' 'It's true,' or 'It's true,' You can say things like, 'I'm doing this on my mobile'" (Ciston, ["Screens for Each Other"](https://screensforeachother.now.sh/)).[^samples]

[^samples]: Work produced by training GPT-2 on an original essay of mine. Another example: "Don't. Be. A. Good. Person. Note: The above list is meant to be a starting point for your own personal journeys. If you are an adult, please read my book, The Myth of the Self" (Ciston, ["Screens for Each Other"](https://screensforeachother.now.sh/)). 

For most genres it may be true what Friedrich Kaplan (2014) says, that “human readers can tell the difference based on a feeling of oddity induced by texts produced by algorithms. These oddities are due to speciﬁc lexical or syntactic biases of these algorithms that often produce syntactically correct sentences---that no natural speaker would ever write” (61). However, not only does poetry prove the exception to this rule, increasing human speakers and writers have begun to digest (or process) the codes of code language, incorporating them into their own syntax and lexicon. He agrees and marks this as one of the dangers of what he terms 'linguistic capitalism': "natural languages could progressively evolve to seamlessly integrate the linguistic biases of algorithms and the economical constraints of the global linguistic economy" (61).

Projects like GPT-2, or now GPT-3, alongside any other project that trains its model relying on a giant corpus of input data provided by the public web, complicate already complex questions of authorship and agency surrounding code and other human languages. With unwitting contributors through web scraping, Open AI's GPT-2 processes are unaccounted for and difficult to trace as a user of the resulting tools. Projects like Mozilla's Common Voice solicit their contributor base but still rely on this multiplicitous network of combined authorship reframed through an obfuscated algorithmic model that introduces and abstracts all manner of influence. How might we take the distributed, co-authored sense of self suggested by these tools, but shift their construction to a more ethical, transparently entangled usage that at least reveals who benefits, if not (ideally) benefitting more involved? How can we even know whose voices are transformed or lost in this process, and whose are dangerously amplified, without that transparency? 

What can an artistic research practice do to reveal the workings of these relational systems---as well as to reveal the potential in their gaps and glitches, errors and excesses that linguistic capitalism attempts to foreclose? To offer a few quick examples of different possible text-driven approaches, [Joanna Moll](http://www.janavirgin.com/)'s [CO2GLE](http://www.janavirgin.com/CO2/CO2GLE_about.html) and [The Hidden Life of an Amazon User](https://www.janavirgin.com/AMZ/) speak to the former and [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)'s _[Compasses]_ speaks to the latter. 

In Moll's [CO2GLE](http://www.janavirgin.com/CO2/CO2GLE_about.html) and [The Hidden Life of an Amazon User](https://www.janavirgin.com/AMZ/) their backend operational necessities become frontend content, as the works themselves are about the systems that enable their existence. "CO2GLE" clocks the carbon dioxide emmissions produced by running the website, and the longer it runs the more its counter increases. Its minimalist design suggests viewers infer the carbon heft that much more robust sites must require. Meanwhile, "The Hidden Life of an Amazon User" displays all (and I do mean _all_) of the source code required to make a purchase on the site (available to anyone through the Dev tools of their browser) as the front-facing text content of the site, along with screen captures of each page as it would load. The text is not so much meant to be read as scrolled through until the wrist fatigue gives a sense of the volume of data being collected and processed on each buyer to produce recommendations and sell them their next purchase. Ironically, this extreme excess of text, produced dynamically (that is, on the fly by procedural processes, preprogrammed software), is designed alternately to narrow choices for buyers in order to create purchases then expand opportunities for purchase again. 

For Kaplan, one of effects of the main operations of linguistic capitalism is to narrow linguistic choice in order to profit from it. He describes how Google Ad Services and other similar algorithmic systems constrain and reshape language: "Autocompletion services can transform linguistic material without value (not much bidding on misspelled words) into a potentially proﬁtable economic resource" (60). By suggesting an alternate spelling it or a nearby word it's already sold at auction (_"showing results for 'cistern'" Google used to proclaim to me until very recently_), vocabulary narrows, services provided narrow, and the processes determining these decisions occur at scales illegible to human perception. "We need to be asking what happens to our words in one billionth of a second" (Sack 2017). Linguistic capitalism narrows human language options, as Kaplan argues, but it certainly creates an excess of machine language---and it points to the potential for other non-economic valuations of language (like poetics) that could utilize machinic and human language excesses and errors. 

[Compasses]: http://sync.abue.io/issues/190705ap_sync2_27_compasses.pdf
![compasses1](https://cdn.glitch.com/eaa18b38-3765-4c0b-8304-2af139b6b542%2FParrish-Compasses1.png?v=1597783585780)

For a brilliant example of this potential at work, [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)'s "[Compasses]" creates a model to "generate new imaginary words that exist in the negative phonetic spaces between the phonetic hidden states corresponding to names of members of well-known quartets." Where Google is literally selling advertisers the space between words (Sack 2017), Parrish's work finds poetic resonance and new language in that space.

My continuing work on ["InnerVoiceOver"](http://innervoiceover.com) tries to use the same space of excess, as well as error, as a field for poetic value: 

>This interactive audio sculpture uses AI to 'rewrite' the inner critic. It explores capacities for error and compassion in both technological and human systems. Listen to its self-compassion database created by other users using text-to-speech technology, or record your own phrase to the database using speech-to-text. Through language altered across digital distance, the piece joyfully shows what its technology fails to do---and how these errors reflect the gaps (and the potential for reconfiguration) between us. (Ciston, exhibition materials)

The work focuses on the errors and excesses produced by the natural language processing tools it employs for its database, the interpretive slippage that allows for a creative leap, where the paradigmatic interrupts the syntagmatic. Rather than as unspoken synonyms like in print writing, Hayles says, "In digital media using dynamic databases, this relationship is reversed. The paradigmatic alternatives are encoded into the database and in this sense actually exist, whereas the syntagmatic is dynamically generated on the fly as choices are made that determine which items in the database will be used. In this sense, the syntagmatic is virtual rather than actual" (53). I use the paradigmatic vectors of the database to suggest poetic, compassionate, imperfect possibilities for the listener, ones that might begin to break down their fixed mystical preconceptions of machine learning and their fixed negative preconceptions of themselves---by connecting them asynchronously to others who contributed text to the database.

A paradigmatic approach suggests or calls for, or I am arguing for, a multiply-situated approach, and this requires acknowledging the limits of any one perspective, perhaps even attempting to imagine through alternate lenses. Tenen suggests a 'machine phenomenology' and says, "Computational poetics, I maintain, encourages users to become active thinkers, tinkerers, and makers of technology" (12). 

Without returning to the mystification of code that Chun warns against, to attempt to think more like machines means at least to leave room for alterity, perhaps room for the alien or non-human-comprehensible components. Luciana Parisi (2013) says that what she calls 'soft thought' is an essential component of understanding the artificial systems of which we are now a part. She describes soft thought as the incomputable, unaccounted for thoughts that infect the computable (xviii), saying, “the effects of the unknown have become the causal motor by which control is unconditionally exercised and driven by immanent decisions about what has not yet happened” (xvii). Importantly, she distinguishes between current ideas of interaction and responsive technology, and this more anticipatory technology which exceeds it (26). She says:

>digital machines are now embedded with a seamful environment of data, in which each level of computation extends into another: not through seamless compatibility but through the incorporation of incomputable data within systems. [...T]he pervasive extension of algorithmic logic has now become attuned to <span class="purple-inline">_alien regions of perception and cognition._</span> These are zones occupied by abstract yet real incomputable states that interfere with computational calculus by <span class="purple-inline">_anticipating new conditions of spatiotemporal experience.</span> (26, emphasis added). 

While I suspect Chun would question Parisi's conjuring of the term 'alien', the emphasis on a distinct level of perception and cognition and a new mode of anticipating experience rather than merely interacting via feedback response are both worth parsing with the material specificity as algorithmic systems grow increasingly automated and abstracted. Both Chun and Hayles argue that code precedes subjectivity because it's happening at spacial and temporal scales outside the scope of human sensorium, (but I would argue not because it is without human influence from other prior actors---as Chun emphasizes it also precedes subjectivity because it is citational). 

### 3.2 conclusion: specific, entangled, situated, emergent

Through this writing, and by combining aspects of the approaches these scholars undertake, I outline a framework for the relationship of self--other--code that is still porous and intersubjective, but now more specific, entangled, situated, and emergent. When we say code, we must know when we mean the language or the system enacting it or the cultural concepts surrounding it, and we must find ways of reading and writing that shift lenses to remain adept with all of the above. One artistic research strategy I find useful is what director Otso Huopaniemi describes (in conversation with Rita Raley) as "'Writing with' in the sense of incorporating part of what the algorithms are suggesting. 'Writing against' in the sense of resisting the influence of automated processes that work to shape languages in ways that make them more practicable for other automated processes. If there is no space for resistance, there is no performance" (Raley & Huopaniemi 2018). I am interested in the space found in resistance they describe, as well as the space for resistance in the gaps between, even when supposedly 'writing with'. Through more nuanced understandings of the layers, relationships, gaps between, ways they shift and influence us, we can poke through and explore the ways we influence in return.
