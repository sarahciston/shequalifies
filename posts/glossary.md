*[algorithm]:
*[api]: application program interface, instructions for interacting with a digital tool or platform using a programming language (e.g. as a 'machine'), rather than through a web browser (as a 'human')
*[dark sousveillance]: Simone Browne's term for the opposing strategies taken up by Black folks in resistence to surveillance practices from above. **EXAMPLE NEEDED**
*[data]: The collection of information provided to an interpretive system, shaped to be interpretable by that system. Data is inscription, thus data is writing. 
*[digital]:
*[digital epidermalization]: Simone Browne (after Franz Fanon): “Digital epidermalization is the exercise of power cast by the disembodied gaze of certain surveillance technologies (for example, identity card readers and e-passport verification machines) that can be employed to do the work of alienating the subject by producing a truth about the racial body and one’s identity (or identities) despite the subject’s claims” (2015, 110).
*[interface]:
*[internet of self]: My term for the distributed sense of self that is digitally entwined, the data body, both digitally co-present and acting without one's knowledge/authorization.
*[information]: Signal and noise. The more randomness, the more information.
*[materiality]:
*[restorative processing]:
*[self]: The self is a technology.
*[subscription capitalism]: Related to the sharing economy and the interface economy (Finn), my term for the shift to economies of abstracted order delivery and video viewing facilitated by algorithms rather than direct human interaction.
<!-- field3 -->
*[feminism]: To D’Ignazio & Klein, "a shorthand for the diverse and wide-ranging projects that name and challenge sexism and other forces of oppression, as well as those which seek to create more just, equitable, and livable futures" (6).
