## labyrinth, a wander

A labyrinth is a visual algorithm written in dirt, read to one's body with the soles of one's feet, processed at any speed. Slow is best. Its simplest form is a spiral, drawn freehand, unthinking, a temporary standin or spiritual ascension. 

At the hospital there was a false labyrinth, and later my brother called it a metaphor for my need to make it harder for myself. Every metaphor is a labyrinth. (I meant to write:) 

Every labyrinth is a metaphor.[^1] Labyrinth as AI black box. Labyrinth as spiritual or psychological quest. Labyrinth as mind itself. 

A self-avoiding walk is a mathematical term. A random walk is also used. Self-avoiding walks are fractals. [^2]

Claude Shannon famously designed this electric maze for his electric mouse to navigate. Here the lone genius with his creation, _Theseus_. Shannon routed this cute little robot toward its electric cheese and the myth of the conquerer continued. Known as the father of the information age, he also built chess playing machines and told us that information is a measure of randomness.

But who is [the woman](https://lt.ikscience.com/98017-betty-shannon-unsung-mathematical-genius-57) [^3] in the photos with Claude Shannon, nearly always unidentified? Sometimes she is proud of what seems to be their creation, as though it is shared (but never captioned as such. Sometimes she appears trapped in the center of a cluster of men stuffed with pride. She is never named or even referred to in captions. The occasional article makes odd reference to Shannon's "wife, Betty, who traveled with him." What are her degrees in mathematics, her contributions to the research, and why is she invisible here? How has she gotten lost in this labyrinth with only one entrance which is also its exit? Who exactly was the monster at its center? Who is still?

When I put myself in Zoom-ready webcam frame in front of the Img2Txt machine learning algorithm, with no particular extra training, it sees: "a woman standing in front of a mirror brushing her teeth." Not scholar with pen or programmer or artist. And this is self-isolation; I haven't necessarily brushed my teeth either. 

I train a new model using a tiny dataset of images of labyrinths, interested in what it will find. Like a hobbiest brushing dust off a chest in an attic more than a scientist with her carefully measured hypotheses.

[^3]: Why is the only page I can find on her that isn't an obituary, that mentions her skills and contributions, translated from Lithuanian?

I only watched the film _Labyrinth_ finally this summer. Raley, Sweeney, other authors, Chun.
